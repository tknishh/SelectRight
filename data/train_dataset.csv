This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Yes.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked extensively on brand communication and content strategy development. Can you walk me through a specific example of how you tailored messaging for a startup client, and what key factors you considered in that process?  \n\n"", 'Interviewee: I worked for a startup called Peacefully, which helps individuals work through end of life necessities and\n\n'], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging but important project. How did you approach the tone and style of the messaging for Peacefully, considering the sensitive nature of the services they provide?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. That was a that's a great question. And I, uh, what we did was we focused on being we looked around, first of all, competitors and saw how, uh, the other businesses that were in the same space spoke because, uh, one way that we recognize to stand out was have distinction in our brand voice. And we recognized that there was, uh, a lot of coldness in their tone. So we really worked on being as empathetic as possible, especially as you mentioned given the sensitive nature of the work. And so we looked at every communication on Instagram, etcetera, and made sure that it sounded like a human being, and that it also sounded like it was, um, even though we were providing necessary information, it was put in such a way that it was considered of where a person may be in their life in terms of potentially having just experienced a loss.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you put a lot of thought into that process. How did you measure the effectiveness of this new brand voice and messaging approach, particularly in terms of user engagement or feedback?  \n\n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. We primarily looked at reviews and actually we interfaced a lot with our, uh, with our client base because, essentially, we were pretty small and we and the first couple people who are using the platform were, um, were essentially the first. So we were able to communicate directly with them. Some of them we actually knew personally. And we got a lot of important feedback about how the flow of information and questions was designed. Uh, we and we we, uh, of course, we were cautious of the fact that the sample size was not huge and but we did insist that people were unsparing in their criticism and then we factored in their feedback. And as time went on and we got more and more feedback, we were then able to test the changes that we were making against, uh, how people were feeling about the content.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: That's a very hands-on and user-centric approach to feedback. Shifting focus a bit, I'd like to discuss your experience with SEO best practices. Can you describe a particularly challenging SEO problem you encountered at White Glove Financial and how you solved it?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Our goal at White Glove Financial was to write new content that would live inside of a platform and, uh, that we had built. And, uh, actually, we had acquired it. We had acquired it from another company, but then we were refining it for our needs. Uh, the company was, uh, the the goal of the company was for financial advisors to stay in touch with clients and recruit new business. And, uh, one of the ways to do that is basically to be introducing topics to people that were, um, that were sufficiently interesting and but would also lead to the conclusion that they could not master the subject themselves. They had to speak to a financial adviser. So what we did was we would have content that lived on our own platform, but we would share it on social media. And I would say the challenge with Facebook social media is, first of all, just from a back end standpoint, they are skeptical of platforms like ours, so we really had to be rigorous in conforming to their, um, their proprietary standards, um, because if you were too boring, uh, in your in any aspect of your content, it would not share that content widely, and it was really working against what we were trying to do for those financial advisors. So suffice to say that that that course that position required a crash course in Facebook SEO in particular, uh, now Meta, but we weren't really primarily using Instagram as much as we were trying to use Facebook because we recognized that that was more in line with where the customer base primarily was interacting on social media.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's interesting how you tailored the content to not only be engaging but also to drive a specific action. Given the challenges with Facebook's algorithm and standards, can you elaborate on some of the specific strategies or techniques you found most effective in ensuring your content was both engaging and compliant with their standards?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. I would say the way to do that within Facebook is that you're essentially just answering line by line as you probably know, um, both, uh, a subject title and then an article title. And so what you would do was, of course, you'd have the article title be something that would be outward facing and engaging. But then sort of the subject title would be, uh, basically a keyword rich thing that Facebook would recognize, um, as something that should be shared widely if someone was, uh, the type of person who was reading, for example, a lot of financial information on Facebook or even the Wall Street Journal, for example, we recognize. Those are the types of people who, um, were, you know, a big part of our demographic. Because the whole point of the financial advisor situation is that you are trying to get people to realize they don't know enough about a subject. And on that end, ultimately, um, while the content was while the goal of the content was this was definitely to be clear, It was also to emphasize the many pitfalls of trying to manage financial, uh, advice and, uh, management of one's portfolio by oneself. So the the goal was definitely not to be, um, muddy, but it was essentially to communicate the the the the crucial importance of getting these decisions right and how also how much of a relief it is when those decisions have been outsourced to someone who is ostensibly a professional because essentially, the financial advisor's pitch is that you don't, um, you know, you don't get get into a limousine with someone who's never driven before, and if you've never driven before yourself, you don't just get behind the wheel of a car and start driving. Um, and and ultimately that, um, while on a surface level, financial decisions are simple from the standpoint of just investing in index funds has has been the operative wisdom for 20 to 30 years. There are also so many decisions underneath, uh, retirement investing. For example, um, management of one's home and estate, education saving and spending, etcetera, um, and then the tax implications of all that that one should be thinking about. And and the goal was to emphasize how a holistic approach like that is so much more advantageous than just thinking, oh, I'm gonna buy um, whatever index fund at a regular price and blah blah blah, and that's all I need to do to be in a good situation financially.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to content framing and targeting is quite strategic. Shifting back to the technical side, could you explain how you approached the technical aspects of SEO, such as on-page optimization or site structure, to ensure the content you were creating for the financial advisors' platform was not only engaging but also highly discoverable by search engines?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Although I think I've kind of done that a few times, but I I guess basically, uh, when you're working, uh, in the back end in meta and you are it it in some part, this was a collaboration with with the, uh, people who had built the platform that we were then using at White Glove, which was, um, which, as I said, was proprietary, but would also allow financial advisors to not only share content via social media, but also keep track of their clients and prospects. It was basically one big dashboard. So, uh, but that the some of the decisions about how to optimize, uh, and get plugged in directly to Facebook and what they needed were being handled by the back end developing people who, uh, who were a separate team, and I was not necessarily a part of that team. They did ask me what what they would love to from me would and I was very simple in my response, which is just, hey. We need, um, we need stuff that looks professional, and we need stuff that looks like it's coming from the Wall Street Journal and other, uh, outlets that people trust because we just don't wanna look like, well, a very bad version of NerdWallet, for example. Um, so but but I will say that, uh, the most of the decisions for how to optimize, um, from a digital standpoint were, uh, were being handled by the back end development team because the goal was not to go viral on Facebook necessarily. The goal was to be much more, uh, personal and and informative and not really trying for fireworks, but really trying to simply just look professional and those that required, um, just building a system that talked to Facebook and answered all the questions and and looked like it was a professional outlet.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you had a strong focus on the user experience and the credibility of the content. Given your role in ensuring the content's professionalism and trustworthiness, how did you collaborate with the development team to maintain a balance between the visual and functional aspects of the platform, especially in terms of SEO considerations?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, the platform was I there's a little bit of a lack of overlap here because the SEO considerations were, um, you know, but they were basically internally handled. And then when it came but when it came to actually, uh, the design of the of the interface itself, um, that it was important that financial advisers would have an easy time navigating that because those were our direct clients. Uh, we weren't dealing with people who were trying to reach financial advisers. We were dealing with financial advisers and and those people can be quite conservative in in their approach. So I would say the the abundance of focus was placed on simply having an easy to use professional looking sort of Charles Schwabbe type interface that, uh, the type of people who were our direct clients, which as I mentioned, were very conservative, basically mid market and small market financial professionals who were just trying to grow their business from 5 to 7 to 9 to 13. Uh, they could be sharing content on Facebook that was not just, hey, I'm a financial advisor, come talk to me, but was professional looking, um, and also, um, and also content that they could trust and that and that emphasize the right content goals, which is let's just get people in the door and start having a conversation regardless of where they're at in life, and especially if they're at a turning point in life, like getting their first job, getting married, etcetera.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's interesting to see how the focus on user experience and trustworthiness extended to the platform's design and functionality. Given the conservative nature of the target audience, how did you approach the content strategy to ensure it resonated with financial advisors and helped them achieve their business growth goals?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That's a great question. It was definitely something that we handled using, um, what what was happening at White Glove while I was there was we were leasing a a content platform, uh, that was widely used, um, and that we were paying a lot of money for, but that allowed advisers to share paywalled content, which was kind of the, uh, opportunity benefit that was being promoted to financial advisers and consequently to their clients, the type of people who, um, basically the incentive would be I'm gonna follow financial advisor x on Facebook because by doing so, I'll be able to read stuff on Forbes and Barron's, etcetera, uh, financial outlets that pay well their content. Bloomberg would be another example. Um, and we were getting away from that. We were we were having to do it ourselves. And so, um, so we we actually had an opportunity to spend 3 or 4 months surveying our current client base of financial advisors and asking them the type of content that they think would be good for their audience. Now we also recognize that they wouldn't necessarily be the best judges of that. Um, for example, uh, we got a lot of feedback about not including or even bothering to write anything about cryptocurrency. That's, you know, that's it was a type of thing that, um, that financial advisers were tired of hearing about, but at the same time, from a from a conversion standpoint in terms of bringing in new clients, it tested extremely highly after the fact for being the type of thing that that people were actually coming in the door and talking about. And that became particularly true as time went on and as we have now reached the point where there are Bitcoin ETFs and soon to be ether ETFs. This is the type of thing that, um, that at least the younger client base of financial advisers work with are definitely interested in diversifying their portfolio and especially given the state of the market right now, uh, in terms of being at an all time high. So, um, so to some degree, we were able to, uh, modulate and control the type of content that financial advisers would see and particularly the stuff that they wouldn't see, but it was also part of my job and our role as a company to convince them that the topics like LGBTQ would be another example that they might consider to be, um, outside of their purview and also potentially politically hazardous are also exactly the kind of things that a, get interest from people, and, b, may potentially grow a client base because, of course, with the younger generation, there are also more gay couples and things like that, and it's and it's financial advisers. Uh, once they use the platform would recognize that if they shared content about that, they could control who got to see it, um, and and and also who didn't get to see it so that they could be less conservative in their approach.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's fascinating to see how you navigated the balance between the financial advisors' preferences and the actual audience engagement data. Given the success of introducing topics like cryptocurrency and LGBTQ finance, how did you measure the impact of these new content areas on the financial advisors' client acquisition and retention?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That was just something that we would reach out, uh, after 6 months, uh, of being on the platform. Actually, we did a small survey at 3 months and then a bigger one at 6 months. And, uh, in addition to the daily feedback that we would be getting through private channels, things like emails and chat, etcetera, that we were, uh, that we were keeping in contact with financial advisers. But we also did a concerted survey to see how these people were feeling about their content. And then, um, and, of course, also ask them to rate the effectiveness of certain content. There were also it's was not a huge client base of financial advisors, so it was the type of people that our account team regularly interface with. And I would say it was a priority of mine to, um, to route as many of those calls over to me as possible and or to be interacting with, uh, the 2 women who were in charge of the account base to hear the anecdotes about how certain content was performing and others not. Um, you know, the the there was never it was never surprised that backdoor Roth conversions were of interest to people, but, uh, it was it was, um, heartening to hear that, uh, social issues were driving as much of the conversation.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you had a comprehensive approach to gathering feedback and measuring the impact of the content strategy. Given the success of this approach, how did you use these insights to further refine the content strategy and potentially explore new areas of focus for the financial advisors' platform?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, I think you just answered the question. We we I would say it's not easy to say how we did that. Uh, that's just what we did. I mean, we we would, um, we would continue to write about basic issues, but, um, I think we recognize that what is a Roth IRA was not the kind of thing that would get the same feedback as something that was a little more incendiary, especially given that we were using social media. So I would say, um, I actually think from the beginning, we bit off a lot of of, uh, news verticals and\n\n""], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you were able to identify and leverage the power of engaging and sometimes controversial topics to drive engagement and conversation. Given this shift in strategy, how did you ensure that the content remained informative and valuable to the audience, even when discussing more incendiary topics?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, I wouldn't say we ever got 2 incendiary, but I would say that, uh, we we worked closely with a, uh, with a company that, um, uh, hired writers on someone's behalf when you were in charge of a team, and they turned out the the you were able to work with the same writer. You didn't get new ones all the time, so we were able to basically say, oh, this is our financial expert and they really get, uh, how we're writing, uh, how we're trying to write in a certain quasi journalistic tone, but but mostly on the informative side of things. And and then when we threw that person, um, a maybe more incendiary topic, and I don't think we ever did anything too incendiary, they knew to write it in our kind of brand voice because that was what that company in particular specialized in. And then I was there as a final judge of whether, uh, the content was adhering to our copy and voice guidelines.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Can you elaborate on the challenges you faced in establishing this partnership and how you overcame them?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. Um, a channel partner, as you probably know, is the partner that's gonna sell your product for you. And, uh, in this particular instance, uh, there was a a company that was consulting with other law firms and other companies, mostly other companies in the in the construction field. And, uh, they processed with the same processing engine, which is Nuix. And, uh, I knew some people there. So I was able to take my personal relationship with them as, uh, as an in, if you will, you know, establishing some trust based on our our prior relationship, our prior performance. And, uh, uh, yeah, I was able to start talking to them. And after, uh, they agreed to take a look at the product, vet it, uh, the the product spoke for itself. It's a good product, and they were happy with it. So it it overcame that kind of initial resistance of, um, offering something they hadn't offered before.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a significant achievement. When it came to vetting the product, how did you address any concerns the partner may have had about integrating Rampiva's solution with their existing workflow, especially considering the unique needs of the construction industry?  \n\n"", 'Interviewee: Well, more properly, the unique workflow is the Nuix processing engine. Nuix is an engine that processes data in the discovery. It then goes into a hosting review platform and a number of AI and and tar tools as well.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: It seems like there might have been a thoughtful approach to addressing these concerns. Can you elaborate on the technical aspects of integrating Rampiva's solution with the partner's existing workflow, particularly how you communicated this to the partner to build trust in the solution's compatibility?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. And I I guess to preface that by saying, I'm not the the technical, uh, consultant on that. I understand the technology, but, uh, you know, at that fine level, we have, uh, uh, subject matter experts. But the key thing here is that, uh, when Nuix processes, it's a very powerful tool, but it's a very cludgy tool. It's very difficult and very high maintenance. So when it came to integrating with their workflow, what we're able to show them is you have this very complicated workflow, uh, uh, in order to take advantage of all the, uh, the firepower, all the technology that you have in in processing. And by using the Rampiva, you're gonna get more out of it easier. So, uh, it's easier for staffing, uh, it's easier in terms of budgeting. And, you know, the key the key thing that grease the wheel, if you will, is that, uh, it allowed them to make far more efficient and economic use of something they already had.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Understanding the high-level technical aspects is definitely crucial for effective sales. Shifting focus a bit, in your role at Ryley Carlock & Applewhite, you led a team of approximately 8 members in eDiscovery and Managed Review. Can you discuss a specific challenge you faced in leading this team and how you addressed it?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Sure. Um, I think the biggest problem that team had was their value proposition, if you will. That's what makes what they were doing better than what other people doing the same thing were. So for example, their their value\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Understanding and differentiating the value proposition is key. How did you work with your team to clearly define and communicate this value proposition to both internal stakeholders and clients, ensuring everyone was aligned on the unique selling points of your services?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, I think internally, uh, they understood it, uh, instinctively, but they didn't really, uh, were able to, you know, render it into something that was easily described. The the value statement for Riley Kerlock's managed review is that it was a law firm quality review, uh, at a discount price. There's different levels of review in the managed review business. You can get, you know, quick, cheap, and dirty overseas. You can get highly technical for things like IP and patent that is very expensive. So they were kind of, um, that law firm level review. That's a good level of review, a sophisticated level review, but kind of at a bargain price. So one of the problems they were having is they were, uh, competing for projects that didn't align with where their value proposition was. Some of them were either too technical or some of them were either, uh, uh, too cheap. They didn't need the value that we had, so they didn't need to pay for it. So the thing to get them working properly was to align, uh, the targets, align the the targets potential customers with the offering that we had. And the way that is done is by, uh, coming up with a marketing plan that targets the right kind of client. The client who, if they were in a position to say yes, it would make sense for them to do so. And that that kind of uncorked the dam and allowed them to start expanding.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Aligning the target market with your value proposition is crucial for business growth. Can you detail the specific components of the marketing plan that helped realign your target clients and expand your business in the right direction?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: No. I think I I think I have to a degree, but I can I can kind of reencapsulate them if you will? Uh, we were looking for clients that needed attorney level review. And, you know, review doesn't have to be done by attorneys. It can also be done by very sophisticated subject matter experts. So we were looking for certain types of review. Usually, a construction, as I've cited, is is 1, general business litigation, you know, things like this. By identifying the, uh, where our values showed up the best, we were able to go and look at practice groups and law firms and go, okay. They do the kind of work that is the kind of work that we're looking for. So by talking to them, we can discuss projects they've had or may have that, uh, could benefit from getting that attorney quality review at a lower price. That makes them more cost effective and more competitive with their clients.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Identifying practice groups and engaging with them to discuss specific projects is a targeted approach. How did you leverage technology or data analytics to identify these practice groups and evaluate the potential fit of their projects with your service offering, ensuring a more data-driven and efficient client acquisition process?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: There's a number of ways to do that. Um, you have to kind of look in 2 large different categories. Larger law firms have a series of practice groups. They'll have some practice groups that are good targets and some that aren't. So if you look at the a law firm, you might say, well, some of this law firm isn't a good practice for is it a good target for me? But if I look at this law firm, if I look at the information that's available through various sources or even going as simple as going to a firm's website and saying, okay. What practice groups do they have? Are these practice groups that are good for us? They are. Then let's reach out to them. Then that's for kind of a general purpose law firm. The the second approach, uh, of kind of leveraging, I guess, you could say analytics, is looking for firms that specialize in these fields. And, yeah, there's a number of tools that are available for that that are relatively simple. And if you've been in the business marketplace for law long enough, there's some that are gonna come to mind. So that kinda gave us a good idea of who to target.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Understanding the different approaches to targeting law firms and specialized firms is insightful. Can you delve into the specific tools or methodologies you used to evaluate the fit of a practice group or a specialized firm, perhaps highlighting a tool or strategy that particularly stood out for its effectiveness in this process?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: I'd have to say it's not so much a tool because they're not that difficult to identify. You can look at a firm's website, or you can look at, you know, what type of law firm it is. It might say, we specialize in construction or mass tort or whatever it might be. Um, but I think it's more of an approach. Right? Uh, what was helpful in that instance was in identifying, uh, firms that did that kind of work was, uh, taking a consultative approach. And that's, I think, you know, the thing that you're asking, right, is what what process do you use? And in a consultative approach, we're gonna ask a lot of questions. We're gonna be lawyerly ourselves. We're gonna ask them about what they do and how they do it and where their pain points are and see if their pain points align with the offering that we have. If they do, we've gone a long way, uh, down the process of identifying someone who could be motivated to purchase our services. So that that takes, um, you know, some some some digging. And more importantly, it takes some listening rather than, you know, letting them talk rather than than you talk at them. Let them explain what their problems are. So I think a key thing there is the consultative approach.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: The consultative approach to client engagement is indeed a powerful strategy for identifying alignment and addressing pain points. How do you ensure scalability of this consultative approach across your sales and client services teams, especially as the business grows and the number of engagements increases?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, the, you know, the number of engagements can increase. The size of the individual engagements tends to remain more constant, at least in the business that I was in. But even in businesses where it's not, right, some law firms might have, 1 or 2 projects a year. Some might have 1 or 2 a month. Um, it's simply a matter of asking the right questions to the white people, and then encouraging to provide you with the information where you can then go to your solution. You can go to your well of information and say, hey. I can help you here. You've laid out to me what you're doing and how you're doing it and where where the pain points are or you know, with a consultative approach, they may not realize they have pain points. They might be doing something and thinking, yeah, it works fine, when you're like, wow, they don't really realize this could be done much more efficiently. So, uh, that's, uh, you know, in terms of scalability, I think it it's simply a matter of, uh, whether the whether it's a large target or a small target, the approach and the process is the same. Of course, as you expand and you add more people, you have more people doing it. So, uh, you know, there's a practical limit, I think, ultimately to how much one person can can juggle. And that varies on a lot of factors that, you know, probably aren't worth going into right now about about the particular business itself.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Understanding the consistency in approach regardless of the size of the engagement is important. What kind of tools or methodologies do you envision implementing to help your teams better capture, analyze, and utilize client data to enhance the effectiveness of the consultative approach at scale?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, I think what kind of tools or processes would I would I, uh, use? I think, you know, part of it is teaching people to listen, teaching them to not just talk at clients of, hey. I have this, this, and this to sell. A lot of people try to I guess they call it feature sell. It's like, this is all the neat stuff that we have, and isn't it great? The problem that you can run into is that your stuff might be great, but if they don't have a need for it, you're wasting each other's time. So I think training might be, uh, one of the key things is teaching people what questions to ask, techniques to get people talking, and identify the right people to talk to and getting them to provide you, uh, the information in a in a give and take. You know, my background is an attorney. Attorneys are are trained to ask questions. Um, and I think people think, you know, they're trained to ask tricky questions, but we're not. We're really trained to ask questions to try to get to the truth of a point or matter. So, you know, there's a a variety of training programs available, but I think that's kind of the key thing is having people who are trained in the consultative approach that know how to use a consultative approach, how to implement it by the type of questions they ask and the process by which they go about their engagement. I think that's the key, and that's the thing that allows you to expand the scalability. And, you know, you can always expand the number of people, uh, on a particular project. You know, you might have a a smaller project and, uh, uh, you know, one person can handle it. But on a larger project, just prospect, you might wanna bring in some subject matter experts. There might be more stakeholders in this in this larger, uh, project. You know, there's a lot of factors that are I hate to sound lawyerly. It's one of those kind of it depends questions. Uh, but, uh, it it depends on a a lot of factors that we that we don't know as you and I are sitting here talking right now about what would what would make us determine what we need to put that consultative approach into effect.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Training and developing a questioning mindset are indeed foundational. Considering the role of technology in augmenting human capabilities, are there any specific data analytics or client relationship management (CRM) tools you believe could complement the consultative approach, especially in identifying nuanced client needs or patterns across engagements?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, these these tools are expanding by the day. Um, you know, for example, I've used the CRM called HubSpot and there there was a time when you were, uh, identifying potential prospect, you have to input manually lots of data about this prospect, you know, what their addresses, phone numbers, you know, uh, you know, information. With HubSpot, um, if you type in their web domain, it'll automatically populate all that information. And a lot of that is information that's useful to you in a consultative approach to go, wow. This is the customers they have. This is the business they have. This is, you know, the numbers they have. This is the growth or declining growth that they have. Um, you know, here's, uh, you know, Wall Street Journal articles, uh, you know, um, you know, the the use of of AI and a lot of these more advanced tools, I think where they really help, uh, it's not that they're better or that humans are worse. Um, I think they're better at some things and worse at others. But the key thing is how do they work together? Uh, I think that's important in the legal space. You know, with attorneys, it's, uh, you know, they tend to be a little off putting, uh, towards a lot of technology. But you have to explain to them and show them how this is a tool just like a a law book was, a typewriter, a pen, or a pencil. Uh, and they're they have to know how to use this tool in order to do their job. And, uh, you know, the\n\n""], [""Interviewer: HubSpot's automation for data input is indeed a time-saver, especially in the initial stages of prospecting. As you've mentioned the use of AI in more advanced tools, how do you see AI being integrated into the consultative approach, perhaps in terms of analyzing client data or suggesting relevant lines of questioning based on patterns identified in the data?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: I think that's that's it right there is, uh, in the consultative approach, the more you know going in, uh, and when I say the more you know, um, there's things that you can concretely know. You know, what a company's revenues are, that's a that's a concrete number. What a company's perception is is not. So, uh, you know, I think the advantage of these tools and the way they can help in the consultative approach is they can provide you information like, you know, are their revenues stagnant? Are they growing? Are they shrinking? You know, this would be helpful, you know, when the when you're consultative approach. You'd say, I see that your business has been on a decline. This practice group, your your revenues have been falling. Um, why do you think that is? Let them tell you. You know, um, the machine, uh, learning there can help suggest the course of action. You know, um, in the actual legal work itself, uh, there's things like technology assisted review that help narrow down out of this massive information. They'll narrow down, um, documents along a certain theme. And the more that you select certain types of inputs, the more it'll deliver those inputs. So I think that's one way that it can help. But I think the key thing is, uh, the the person and the and the artificial intelligence working collaboratively, um, is greater than either one of them as an individual. And the, uh, ability to help provide factual basis to your questions that are gonna be the core of your consultation, I think, is probably the key there.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Leveraging AI to understand and interpret less concrete aspects, such as a company's trajectory, is indeed a powerful application in the consultative approach. How do you envision ensuring that the human-AI collaboration remains transparent and understandable to your team, so they can effectively incorporate AI-generated insights into their client engagements?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, I think there's a couple things I think. It has to it has to have a track record right as you use it. It needs to be solid. If the AI is giving you information that says this company is on a downward trajectory and it's on an upward trajectory that's going to cause a problem. I think just like a human being everything is always in a state of flux. It's in a state of growth and evolution and adjustments. So there might be situations where AI makes mistakes now ai doesn't make mistakes the way maybe I would of Simply being wrong, but it is subject to the the garbage in garbage or problem to a certain degree. So you is that happens? I think a process where We acknowledge that this can happen and that it doesn't AI tells us something it doesn't relieve us of the responsibility to do something on our own. I think of this process of Correction adjustment and increased learning is known and open and followed then I think you know people will work with it better just like they would a person or do the same circumstances\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Can you walk me through a specific project where you successfully integrated business intelligence solutions within a project management framework? What were the key challenges you faced and how did you overcome them? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, when I was working for a start up called Aventura, I used business intelligence, to create the sales structure, how business intelligence Well, we we needed to to look and to search, little of data So I used some tools to, develop a system where we create a pipeline pipe, yeah, pipe drive where we have pipelines. That structure help us to create basically the go to market plan where we qualify with all this information and and if you need and clean this cleaning this information. With, with, forgot to go to market plan. Sorry. And having this this go to market plan, we can reach, this up okay. This app and, well, all the project, right, of Aventuraza. At this at at the same time, I needed to control all of the workflows for this project because, basically, I was the leader, but I have people, searching, for the information for my prospects of future clients. So I most control every aspect of, the tasks, and I I break task I kind of did a sprint, so I did a mixture between, between, some methodologies of project management So we create a backlog, we did springs, where at the end of the day, we needed control. So using Asana, we have this project manager control. Project management control. So that is why I can consider that business intelligence to create the business and project manager to project management to, control all the tasks to be on time with the project, and that's it.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach to integrating business intelligence and project management. Can you elaborate on the specific business intelligence tools you used to develop the pipeline structure in Pipedrive? Additionally, how did you measure the effectiveness of this integrated system in terms of sales performance and project delivery? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. So, basically, as we were in a start up and we have no money, all the all the tools that we use to clean up the data, to qualify data, and yes, basically, to have a nice set of data. Was, made by Google Sheets. Right? It was with let's say, that it was, like, we were creating our ideal software Right? But with the resources that we had, not spending money, being ingenious, to create this, tool but using mainly spreadsheets from Google. That that was it, how how how we did it. And you repeat the second question, please?\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's impressive how you leveraged Google Sheets for such a critical aspect of your project. My second question was about how you measured the effectiveness of this integrated system. Specifically, what key performance indicators (KPIs) did you track to ensure that the pipeline structure and project management approach were driving sales and project completion in the desired direction? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Certainly. So, basically, with this Google Sheet solution that we created. I created as well a dashboard. Right? This dashboard can be able to measure all the activities for 2 departments. The first one was for sales, and the second one was account manager. Right? Because I was in charge of both departments. So area. Sorry. So, basically, for sales, I created this dashboard, as we were in an earlier stage of launching and of the go to market plan. I used to measure everything. From, number of calls, number of effective calls, number of approaches during the day, during the week, during the month. So the first KPI that I created well, that I used was number of calls versus effective calls just to have a rate. Right? Or effective effectiveness effectiveness rate. Of our calls. And having that, we start creating a an an improving and and our features start improving and evolving to have a a a better approach. Right? Because we were doing that in all the processing, cold calling or with with one call, 2 calls, 3 calls, when the prospect accepted. And we sync when we when sign up. So, basically, I I use it like that. To measure that and with account manager was account management was almost the same, but the KPI was okay. So, I used to met I I used to my metric my main metric was how many calls are you receiving, how many calls are finding a solution? So let's say so receive calls against solutions made. So those were my basic metrics during that project in Alenduriza's start. That's it.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: The way you defined and tracked KPIs for both sales and account management is quite insightful. Shifting focus a bit to your experience with project management methodologies, you mentioned using a mix of methodologies. Can you elaborate on the specific aspects of both PMI and Scrum that you found most valuable in the context of your project at Aventura? How did you tailor these methodologies to suit the startup environment and the nature of your projects? \n\n', ""Interviewee: So, basically, I needed to make a make sure because, as I told you, the resources were not as big as we wanted. The money resources and obviously the human resource. Right? So I was in charge of 2 areas, but my stakeholders were, for instance, the project management area. And, development team were were my stakeholders. And as I was talking to the prospects and clients, I must gave that information, that feedback, and that insights to them. So in Aventura, we created this material methodology. We had, some aspects from scrum, to break tasks. Right? We have a a backlog, We have from the PM, PMP methodology, we have briefs. Why? Because we wanted all to understand the basic concepts So we have this brief of every, project that we needed to be, working with. As as as a unit, as a business unit, not not not as, different or independent business units. And we we, as as I was involved with, a developer development process, I needed to understand how was the sprints the the waterfall methodology. So basically, we took several, elements as you can as you can hear. From different methodologies to create our own, and we add a that to, Asana that was the tool that we were used to to to to that that we use. Sorry. And as well, the communication is very important in those stages early stages So we use, for that Slack. We use Envision. Well, Slack for the communication, and, you know, we can open threads and we can go directly depending on the topic to give some, follow ups. We we use as well Invisio to get to see the dummies or of of the app. Right? How, how it it it it, how was, evolving the the deliveries from every model model of the app. And, last but not least, we, used to to I don't remember in this moment the name of the tool, for that but that tool was work for workflows. Because that was so important for us. Just take a look through the workflows and try to understand that and look for improvements. On those workloads. But I be honest, I can't remember the name of of that tool. I can look for it right now, but, or after the interview, and I can give you guys a follow-up. About that, too. That's it.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: The way you combined elements from different methodologies to suit your specific needs at Aventura is quite innovative. Given your experience with these methodologies and the tools you mentioned, how did you ensure that the project team remained aligned and focused on the project's goals, especially with the dynamic nature of a startup environment? What were some of the key communication and collaboration strategies you found most effective in this context? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: You just said it. The communication is basic and essential for the success of a project. And, understanding as well the backgrounds of every member of the teams is important. Right? Empowering the decisions be clear on the tasks, and be clear on the concepts. That is why for me, the best tool and in my experience, the tool that always help that with with that, it's having a brief of the project a clear, concise brief, where we, in the first two sheets, we, understand what is the objective of the of the task or or even the project. We understand that, how how far we want to go with it. What are the resources we want to know, having a a timeline. It's so important always. To this brief to consider to consider that, to have a timeline. And last but not but not least, perhaps the this could be the the first the first point of this. The most important is aligning the concepts. Right? Because for some person,\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given the critical role of clear communication and alignment on project goals, how did you handle situations where team members had differing interpretations of the project brief or objectives? Can you describe a specific instance where this misalignment occurred and the steps you took to realign the team and ensure everyone was on the same page? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Aligning the concepts. I mean, in the brief, just having, like, a glossary of of aligning the concepts that would be that would do it in my experience. And, the most of the times when I found this, misalignment was when we get somebody new into the team or when a leader just said, okay. So you know what? I don't have time for this, so my right hand is going to with this. That's one that's another thing. You know? Leaders need to be involved. As far as they can, as far as they can understand or with the time that's far as they can because of the times. But they're we need always a person of every area to be involved all the time with the project and reporting to those superiors. Otherwise, the communication, it's going to be a problem.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that involving key stakeholders and maintaining consistent communication channels are crucial for project success.

What was the outcome of that decision? \n\n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. When when as I mentioned, I created a go to market plan for this startup.

Can you describe the process of data validation and the tools or methodologies you used to maintain data integrity? \n\n', ""Interviewee: analyzing this data I I I qualified every every prospect depending on the data. We obtain the data from social network and from cold calling. So we have direct access to the this data because we, we check that data with the person that we're creating the businesses. Right? So for me, it was so important just to have this data clear this data updated. And as having that, we qualify the prospects We gave them a number depending on the data that we obtained, free surprises, locations, services, and different data. Right? If They got social network and all the tools that we use were we're maintaining or or were developed by my sales crew because they were researching everything. In these early stages, for me, it's so difficult just to put, an an AI to understand the data because as we were creating this startup, first of all, I want to to understand all the data, the market, and the trends. And afterwards, perhaps use another, AI, to help me, creating dashboards or predicting some trends with the historical information. That's for me my answer.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given the reliance on manual data collection and analysis in the early stages of your startup, how do you envision the integration of AI or machine learning technologies to enhance your data analysis processes in the future? Can you provide some insights into the specific aspects of data analysis or decision-making that you believe AI could significantly improve within your sales and project management workflows? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. I mean, in my go to market plan, I definitely organize, and and I I have a a a visualization. Of having an AI or customer service, even for sales. You know? It it it is important. How am I going to do that? Just comprehending the data or showing to the intelligence how to talk to the clients, how programming the tone of the company and, trying to teach the intelligence how to make sales upsells and define if, some, client needed needs depending on historical information, obviously. Need a new solution or just to strong I mean, not strong. Needed to verify the actual solution that you're using. So that is why, I I really think that artificial intelligence will help us to do that for salespeople, and we will have more and more and more time to deal with another, another daily basis problems.

So, basically, we did the financial modeling to model it out for 5 years, and then we discovered that by changing our products, into as a service offerings, then we could project 38 $1,000,000 increase in revenue because you increase annual recurring revenue with a subscription process. So, basically, after I got the buy in, we changed several products, including printers. That was the case study that we did at Sanrico. We're basically in stack. Beforehand, Rico was selling and leasing their printers and copy machines. And when I came on board, after doing the financial analysis and getting the buying throughout upper level management, I was able to, sure, let them know that it's feasible, it's profitable, and we turned copy machines into an as a service offering for mids mid midsize businesses, which made sense for them because now mid level companies can afford the machinery that they needed to create conduct their business. So that successfully was launched, and we again project an increase in our of $38,000,000 just by the methodology that I that I did was by by talking to several people, getting insights, and getting feedback from customers, not getting feedback from internal partners like finance, marketing, sales, and then building the right financial models that showed the proformas and showed annual recurring revenue how much it would increase by turning all the products into a subscription based product.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for that detailed response. What potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in transitioning the flagship software product to a subscription-based model? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, the challenge would be to help organizations accept the the the the product as a service as their business as usual case in the methods. And the way to do that is to show them that it's financially feasible feasible for small to medium sized businesses to be able to afford subscription because you don't have to commit to a term. You pay on a month to month basis. And with the prices right and if they're happy with the service, they continue paying for their monthly subscription as long as they've received the service and they're utilizing the services from your product. That's the way you can overcome the make sure you understand what the customer wants, make it a customer centric product. And then go forward with providing that to the market.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: What would be the key steps or milestones in implementing your proposed solution for transitioning to a subscription-based model? \n\n', 'Interviewee: Well, I would work with upper level management to set up those key steps. The key steps would be to get approval from finance to get approval from legal. To teach the sales executives the new method of selling teach them the new products that we are offering. So all these different objectives to take step by steps, different approval processes, and then just get sales to buy into it by teaching them and instructing them you know, why it be to their best advantage to sell their products to their customers on subscription based off And then we can get accounting to buy to to provide some financial projections as well on how ARR would increase. By turning into a subscription based product.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: What potential trade-offs or compromises might need to be made during the implementation of this transition? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Different pricing structures if you are going to end the the term of length when it comes to trying to figure out what is the best option for a customer. Because, for example, small to medium sized customers, they don't want longer time commitment. So trying to find the appropriate length of the term of a contract and then finding goods good products to turn into subscription based models that that the customers will actually attracted to. So trying to find the demand would be an obstacle, and you know, advertising is some way to generate demand for someone these products. And those are some of the things that I would recommend to my future employer about how to overcome some of these obstacles.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: What opportunities for future enhancements or expansions do you see once the subscription-based model is successfully implemented? \n\n', ""Interviewee: I think it gives the customers a bit more control as to what they want to buy, how they wanna buy. It gives them more flexibility It makes it easier through transact with companies. When customers are actually have a subscription based product. So there's lots of bad management. Customer satisfaction, easy to transact, it's more affordable for customers. These are the type of things that I would recommend or would be the future of this type of product going forward.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your insights. How would you measure the success of the transition to a subscription-based model once it has been implemented? \n\n', 'Interviewee: I would measure this cassette the success by the number of sales at the sales people are acquiring. So I would do constant monitoring of the sales pipelines and, you know, work with marketing, work with sales. And to be able to identify which areas we need to reach. Therefore, by doing so, we can have a team effort between sales and marketing. And to try and get these products moving forward.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: What specific metrics or KPIs would you track to ensure the subscription-based model is performing as expected? \n\n', ""Interviewee: I'm sorry. I didn't get the question.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: What specific metrics or KPIs would you track to ensure the subscription-based model is performing as expected? \n\n', ""Interviewee: For example, I would measure the pipeline as to what the pipeline was looking at, the funnel pipeline, the sales, whether it's a lead all the way down to generating a sale. And report those metrics to both sales and marketing.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your detailed responses. How would you handle customer feedback and incorporate it into improving the subscription-based model? \n\n', ""Interviewee: I would send out surveys once a year to make sure that customers are enjoying the new products. And then based on those surveys, I would adjust the offerings to make it more customer centric because that's the way you get buying from customers. You make your product customer centric, you make your company customer centric. Then you're able to come up with great products for them. So constantly, monitoring the usage of customers' products, make sure that they're in increasing the usage, and get feedback from them through constant surveys throughout maybe throughout throughout the year, once every few years.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your approach. What strategies would you use to retain customers and reduce churn in the subscription-based model? \n\n', 'Interviewee: By keeping customers happy by providing the products that they want, that they need, by finding niche markets that no one has tapped into, these are some of the things that I would follow.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: How would you ensure that your team remains aligned and motivated throughout the transition to a subscription-based model? \n\n', ""Interviewee: We'll always provide encouragement. I'm always actively supervising team members, but just speak to me. I'm making sure what their skills are, what how or where they're making a a a significant impact in the company. So I'm always monitoring and giving encouragement to feedback on a discreet level, making sure that employees are up to dates on their trainings, and they're doing what they're supposed to do.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your thorough responses. What role do you see technology playing in the successful implementation and management of the subscription-based model? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, I think with technology, you know, with AI driven advances, we're able to identify better customer basis. Customers are able to better identify their products. And maybe through artificial intelligence, we're able to align that technology to put together customers with products.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: How would you leverage Business Intelligence tools to support the transition and ongoing management of the subscription-based model? \n\n', ""Interviewee: So besides Excel and doing the financial models in Excel, there's also Tableau, there's Looker, there is Power BI that I'm familiar with. And I would take all this data, and I would come up with charts and graphs and other visualizations for upper level management to see what the state of affairs are.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your approach. What steps would you take to ensure data integrity and security while using these Business Intelligence tools? \n\n', ""Interviewee: As I said before, you double check, double check, double check all of the data to make sure it's correct. So you make sure that the data is complete. Correct, concise, and current. With that, you'll find this dataset is wealth of information you can use to be able to show whatever visualizations you need and what visualization tool software.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your detailed responses. How would you prioritize and manage the key steps or milestones in your proposed solution to ensure a smooth transition to the subscription-based model? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, step by step, I would calculate the steps that are needed to transition to the state model, but to a subscription state model. But, basically, just working with finance and working with accounting to make sure that everything is right, to make sure that we understand ASC's 06 guidelines, which are guidelines that are set for, recognizing revenue with respect to subscription based products. So just having a good sense of ASC 606 and working with accounting. We are better able to tackle some of these issues in bubbles.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your insights. What potential risks do you foresee in this transition, and how would you mitigate them? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, the potential risk is that you just never know if the customer is going to stick with the subscription product. And if they cancel early, then you are you're out of luck. And you lose some AR. So basically, just keep the customer informed, keep the customer happy, make sure that the salespeople are always in constant contact with the customers to make sure that we don't lose that customer. We keep growing our ARR.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your thorough responses. How would you handle competition and ensure your subscription-based model stands out in the market? \n\n', 'Interviewee: Well, I would do competitive analysis to try and check and see what our competitors were doing, what their products were, what were good and bad about their products, and give all these detailed market research reports to upper level management to know what the other people are doing, what the other players are doing, and how we can stay competitive ourselves.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your approach. How would you ensure continuous improvement and innovation in the subscription-based model after its initial implementation? \n\n', ""Interviewee: I'm working with developers, making sure that there's constant innovation in the product. If the product stays stale, then it's not going to sell for much longer. So just by constantly innovating and working with develop teams, coming up with new ideas and brainstorming, People keep up with technology and make even better technology to keep people, keep customers happy with their subscription based products.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your detailed responses. How would you align the subscription-based model with the overall strategic goals of the company? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Number 1 priority because it's a transition that the company, Rico, that I was working with beforehand, which trying to do. They made it their North Star project, which is trans to transform all the products into as a service or subscription type products. And so, therefore, just, you know, that would be the best best to do is just stay on it and to be humble about your work, but also to be prepared with what challenges might come your way.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your approach. How would you communicate the benefits of the subscription-based model to both internal stakeholders and customers? \n\n', 'Interviewee: Well, through through memos, through newsletters, and through PowerPoint presentation, I would do quarterly to make sure that all levels of management knew exactly how things turn.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: Thank you for your insights. How would you ensure that the pricing strategy for the subscription-based model is competitive and attractive to customers? \n\n', 'Interviewee: I would do a pricing comparison with other products from other competitors in the market. That sometimes means, like, mystery or secret shopping, and just understand what the competitors products are, understand their pricing, and make our pricing similar to theirs, if not even more competitive to be able to get a greater market share for our product.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview?\n', 'Interviewee: Review? Yes.\n'], [""Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've worked on a project involving sentiment analysis on US Airlines Tweets. Could you walk me through the NLP techniques you used for this project and how you implemented them?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. Uh, so initially, the after the dataset extraction that we did from Kaggle, basically, uh, we had tweets from various US airlines. I think it was 6 US airlines. Uh, so we had to filter out the text of the each tweet because now we need to determine the, um, kind of content or the that sentiment, basically, of those, uh, tweets. So the content has to be filtered. Now the filtration steps or, basically, the NLP steps that we use initially was the first of all, was the stemming. We had to make the word back to its stem form or the root form, um, so that the so that, uh, there could be single let's say, there's a word called as, um, jump and jumping. So both of their the meaning is same, but there's an I n g added to the jumping part. So we don't want our model to get confused between the meanings of the context of both of the words. So we perform the stemming and convert the words to back to their root forms, uh, stem forms. Uh, then the next step was the lemmatization. Now lemmatization is basically mapping, uh, checking their values, uh, whether in the dictionary, the stemmed word exists or does not exist. So what happens is it also converts the word back to the root form or the stem form, but it also checks that the stem form or, uh, uh, the form that has been generated in the word that has actually some meaning in the dictionary. So that mapping part is extremely important there because it could happen is that, uh, let's say there's a word intelligent and intelligence. Now meaning of both them is same, but it could happen that, uh, while stemming, it removes the t from the intelligent at the end and c e from intelligence. So it becomes intelligent, which actually or technically is not a word in a dictionary. Although we humans can understand, but our models will become ambiguous and, uh, get confused. So what we do is that we perform a a step of limitation instead of showing there. What we do is that we check whether, uh, a word exists, let's say, intelligent. So that word does not exist, so we'll eliminate it. So what we will do is that intelligent will be kept as the word, uh, lemmatized word. So that is the second step. Then we went for the tokenization. Basically, tokenization was the first part as well, so it was evolving around mixing of them. Uh, the to tokenization is when we convert the whole sentence or the whole tweet into various multiple tokens. Let's say the sentence is my name is Shivanshu, so it will convert my name is Shivanshu. Or let's say the movie that I watched today was good, so it will just separate them all back into the, uh, individual tokens. Then we perform the stop word removal. Now this is very important because there are various words which are called as stop words. These stop words are those words which does not actually contribute any contextual or meaningful, um, impact to the model. Let's say there's and, there's or, there's but, these types of sentences these types of words or tokens do not contribute, um, in a very high level impact to the NLP model. So we try to remove them and just try to contain maximum information and minimum number of words or minimum amount of words. Then we performed, um, then we also performed the, um, mapping them with the, um, I forgot the name, um, it was around. So after the the the tokenization, uh, stemming lemmatization, uh, we performed yeah. We are the vectorization. Then the vectorization we also performed small techniques such as small, uh, converting them to lowercase capitals, um, removing few various links that was done through regular expression. Uh, because there could be hyperlinks and there could be, uh, Twitter handles, which we don't want. We could, like, basically convert the links into another column and, uh, write another column such as tweets, uh, text of the tweets, um, links, and then the handles. So that that was the then there was the vectorization techniques. I think I used the TFID vectorization technique of the inverse document frequency dome frequency, inverse document frequency. There, we try to see how many times a word has occurred in a particular tweet and a in the complete corpus and what does it contribute, and how much does that, uh, word's contextual meaning contribute towards the whole of the tweets. I think that was overall, um, um, the process that we used there.\n""], [""Interviewer: It sounds like you've implemented a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline for the text data. You mentioned stemming, lemmatization, tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF. Can you elaborate on how you evaluated the performance of your sentiment analysis model and what metrics you used to determine its accuracy?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Sure. Um, the sentiment analysis metrics that we use to basically um, analyze, uh, the, um, the evaluation metrics that we use to analyze were, um, of course, it's a classification thing that we um, identify the tweet as a positive tweet or a negative tweet. So we or even a neutral, so 3. Um, so we use confusion metrics. That was one thing that we implemented, and we tried to find out the false positives, the false negatives, um, and all the true positives, true negatives so that we can better understand the question. Then we have also implemented the accuracy, the, um, loss, whatever loss rate was coming out. Then we implemented the f one score basically using the accuracy and precision. We implemented the precision recall f one score. Um, so all in all, we we wanted to explore because in classification, accuracy is not always what matters. We also have to see what kind of accuracy that we are getting. There could be a true positive, true negative accuracy that we are getting, so we have to understand that as well. So what we use is f one score that we also implemented in our model. This f one score is based on precision and recall and gives us a very high idea about, um, a balanced idea about how our model is performing. So we use f one score, error rate, um, precision recall, and accuracy, uh, and the confusion metrics as well. Yeah.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a solid approach to evaluating a sentiment analysis model. Using the F1 score to balance precision and recall is particularly important in imbalanced datasets. Shifting gears a bit, I noticed you have experience with web scraping. Can you describe a project where you utilized web scraping, and which tools or libraries you used to extract the data?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. Um, I don't think it's mentioned in my resume, but I actually worked on a project. Um, that project was basically an idea that came into our mind when we when I participated with my team in a cyber police hackathon that held that was held by the police. Uh, so the the the the the topic was about dark web investigation and cryptocurrency analysis. We just wanted to mix both of them as on dark web. Uh, the problem is that we cannot perform steps directly as it requires a Tor browser to be opened. So there's a lot of complexity involved there. So even web scraping there is a bit difficult because you cannot directly or you cannot automate the opening of the browser in the next, um, then automate the, uh, web scraping stuff. The the, uh, this is just one thing. The other thing was that on dark web, there are no, uh, information that we can actually gather from the website. Because of web websites, however, being very simple, they have absolutely no content or no related information to the user. The only thing sometime we can find is, let's say, there's a marketplace, illegal marketplace on dark web. Uh, it will have a cryptocurrency address, uh, a wallet address which we can use which they basically ask for us to pay them, and then they'll provide the services. So what we wanted to do was we wanted to extract or we wanted to find those IP addresses. Oh, sorry. We wanted to find those cryptocurrency addresses, uh, wallet addresses, and then fetch those addresses. And then we had few OSINT tools. OSINT tools are basically, um, open source intelligence, um, intelligence tools. So these tools are used in, uh, various offensive, um, analysis of, uh, let's say, a lot of malicious activities or to check trails of cryptocurrencies. So what we use was we basically got those crypto addresses, and then we put them or basically automated them. Uh, after getting them, we would forward that request to the to those who send tools, which are available online, of course. Um, and then we would gather the information about the, uh, crypto crypto wallet address, basically, uh, getting a trail of, uh, the how much the Bitcoins or the how much the payment has been following. And from one user to another, what kind of, um, stuff has been following. So there, I use the web scraping part. I use the Selenium library of Python, um, because I initially was used used to use Beautiful Soup, but, apparently, there are a few complex issues in Beautiful Soup, such as FindAll, which basically, uh, there's an ambiguity in string and, um, the function of, um, the beautiful soup itself. So I don't prefer that. I use Selenium. I we use that to basically fetch or scrape the information. When we passed, uh, we created an API which would pass the where you would pass the crypto address, then we'd get the then it would be passed to a website where all the information will be there about the crypto trail, about the crypto wallet address, about the money sent there, about how many bit packets are traced, and what and a various lot of informations. That that information was to be scraped. So I created a scraping script there, and that would fetch all of that information and get me back the results.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a very innovative use of web scraping and automation for a critical purpose. Using Selenium for such a complex task is quite impressive. Given your experience with both web scraping and NLP, how would you approach a project that involves scraping text data from websites and then performing NLP tasks on that data, such as topic modeling or text summarization?  \n"", ""Interviewee: um, yeah, I think the web scraping of course is a very what should I say a very important factor or a very important tool in the whole idea of automation because come on what do we need to automate is basically to get the data either we sit down and manually get down the data which is not at all automation or we can sorry or we can get the Again, sorry and we can get the complete automation through web scraping. So let's take the example of the text summarization that you talked about. I actually worked on this project. I think I didn't I didn't get the chance to finish it. But yeah, I knew that so basically the approach was to that. We had a few blog articles of a particular guy. I don't exactly remember the link or the website of his blog. So what do you wanted was to basically get a summarized text of all his blogs so that he can like put it on a on his LinkedIn post or in on an Instagram post for a social media promotion. So he asked us to do that. So what we did was we basically use a website. I created a script for web scraping using selenium there. I used multiple web stripping tools to extract his blog articles and then all the text has to be passed to the NLP model. First of all, of course, you'll have to apply them to the pre-processing chain, of course involving the various steps of stemming limitations the vectorization even small we have to remove various stop for removal, of course. And then a small converting them back to a small Capital small letters all of these. Precepts will be first performed and then the extracted text or the extracted passage. The automatic web scraped passage will be then passed to our model and then our model will basically learn about these and then at the end give us a textual summary about that complete the complete passage. Now, there are I think two types of the summary text summarization techniques one is the exhaustive summary and one is the implemented or something. I don't remember the name, but the one is where it basically checks the it just basically extract is the most important sentences. The other is where it completely understands the text and then rewrite those as a complete summary. So I think that will be the first approach that I'll be scrap the data from the website and using selenium various tools and get the text important texts and all the text that is required for my and more than pass them through the natural language processing steps such as token tokenization stemming limitation stopped removal and then convert them to vectorization because of course It's a very important step. We have to see whether TF idea works there or they could also be counted by transition that could work there after that. We apply them and pass them through a model we could also use Board model there. Basically, I mean come on. It's a sequence to sequence model. So it will help us in it's a Transformer which is a bad directional and coder. I think it could work very well. I think that's that would be my Approach.\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to text summarization using web scraping and NLP is quite thorough. It's clear you understand the importance of preprocessing and the different types of summarization techniques. The use of a transformer model like BERT for more advanced summarization is also a forward-thinking strategy. Given your experience with AWS, can you discuss a time when you had to use AWS services in a project or work setting, and how you leveraged them to achieve your goals?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so this was very recently. 1 of so, basically, I used to, like, do small steps of, um, college professors or, uh, of friends. Basically, they would ask me when they were, like, working on some website setups and all. So they had to, like, work on a project where, um, they had done the part about the project where they, like, had to find out the species of the animal. So they wanted me to perform that for them. So what I did was that, uh, I used the AWS's recognition, um, what is it called, service. Yeah. AWS's recognition service to basically identify the image, uh, and recognize the species of the image. Uh, we I had to modify a lot of things because it gives information in multiple layers. Like, it will tell that it is a mammal, and then any mammal also, let's say if it's a cow, then you'll say that it's a cow. Then even if it's a cow, let's say it's a spotted cow. So it could even go down to that that it's a black spotted cow or something. Even we are telling the multi, um, species of that cow as well. So we're not interested in that. We just wanted to know whether it's a cow or not. So I modified that layering and asked just to fetch the name of the animal. So it would basically fetch the name of the animal whenever we'll click on the submit button where the image is uploaded, and then the user has to wait for the answer from the AWS site. So the AWS recognition species, uh, recognition service was connected. Uh, I also had to implement the AWS's API end module because, uh, I had to, of course, create various endpoints for the a AWS API to handle. So, uh, I had to create Lambda functions to handle these AWS API endpoints. But the the initial setup was, uh, that the user will upload the animal image. He'll basically click on the submit button. He'll wait, and then this request, after clicking on the submit button, will be passed on to the, um, to the to the AWS Lambda function where the AWS first AWS endpoint will be hit, and that AWS endpoint will trigger the, uh, will create a trigger function or the trigger function. Yes. Um, that function will, um, find the specie fetch the image from the, uh, user, and then store it in the s 2 bucket s 3 bucket. Sorry. And that s 3 bucket, after storing that image in the s 3 bucket, it will gather the, um, uh, it will basically trigger another function, which was actually initiated in the s 3 bucket itself that whenever an image is stored in that, so what it will do is that it will basically trigger the, uh, AWS's recognition species and find out the species of the name, uh, final species of the animal, and then return back the results, uh, where the other, um, return back the results into a, uh, database that we were maintaining uh, with the serial number and the number of, um, the request from the user that has been submitted and the name of the animal with the image of the animal. So that was there. And we also had another DynamoDB table, which I I had to initially create. That DynamoDB table had multiple animals and their information required in them. So what happened was that, uh, after we got the animal name, that will trigger another API. And what it will do is that that function will go ahead and fetch the name of the animal and the information of the animal from the DynamoDB table. All of this will be then returned back to the user. We also implemented Amazon Polly. Uh, that was for, um, voice, uh, answer. He wanted to also get a voice result where the voice announces that the species is this and the, um, whatever the information we have faced from the DynamoDB, that is also announced. So that was something that I had implemented in Amazon Polly. So whenever we got the information as well back, then when we sent it back to the user to display it on his out out, um, his printing or the output of the display screen, we also triggered an API, uh, to Amazon Polly, which would fetch us the voice note icon as well where he could click and just get the voice result as well.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a very practical application of AWS services, combining Rekognition for image analysis, Lambda for serverless computing, S3 for storage, DynamoDB for a NoSQL database, and Polly for text-to-speech capabilities. It's clear you have a strong understanding of how to architect solutions using AWS. Given your experience with these services, how do you ensure the security of data when using AWS, especially when handling sensitive information like images and user data?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, of course. See, uh, whenever we go ahead in AWS, the first thing, uh, the the declined or the the person who was ready to give me his credentials, which I, of course, declined because that is not how I work. I told him that the first and foremost step of security in AWS is to create another account and then give me the rights for those particular account. Basically, create a user group or assign me a role where I have the, um, necessary permissions for the services. So in AWS, there's a quote we say that, um, we should only give services we should only give permissions to the minimum number of, uh, services that is required to the, um, to to the user or the programmer. So, um, I was given these services. So I asked him to design, and I asked him to, uh, basically, um, allow me the permissions for those particular services such as the recognition, the Lambda function, the, uh, poly, and the DynamoDB. Um, so after those, I have that. Now I had to make sure that the data, um, that the data privacy and the data security concerns are, of course, being handled there. So what we used to do was, uh, I used to I, first of all, created an s three bucket with the, um, um, completely, um, no public access so that nobody could access only the API points where the user would trigger. User would upload and when the submit button is clicked, that it will go into that SDK bucket. Also, I had a simple folder, which was called the input folder that would have the images in them and the output folder, which would have the multiple information in them as well. So that was one of the things that I made sure that, um, it is make sure. I also assigned various, um, I I also initiated the, uh, two factor authorization, um, because multiple authorization is very important, uh, MFA, um, because, uh, I didn't wanted anybody to access that private data. So whenever I had to access that data, I also had to contact that guy because he was the owner. So he would have to tell me the, um, of course, the the second, uh, factor authorization, and then only I could log in in that. So that was one of the privacy security concern concern that I made sure that not even I could make misuse of that data. Um, in the sense of DynamoDB tables also, I made them extremely, um, under extremely restricted to the public access. They were only available for the, uh, they were only available, and the effects that they were allowed were the triggering of the, um, APIs and the fetching of the information. There was nothing that the user could, um, that me or another person, um, with even a a smaller access of with a smaller access could write into them the, um, in the the in an element table. He could not make any edits without the permission of the, of course, the owner. So I think I assigned various roles and groups security groups, and, um, assigned each of the service with the, um, only the permission only the necessary permission that was required.\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

And, uh, the challenges I have faced was, like, using proxy websites because many have searched have a cloud fair which, uh, detects the bots, so it was very difficult to avoid those things and I have to scrape the data from there. So most of the website level of site use those things Cloudflare and it would it would detect the bot moment. So I had to, like, slow down the space. I have to recently change the network IP address. So in the these, I had to overcome these things. And after this, all these things, so I was able to overcome with the help of Stack Overflow. So this were all, uh, before the Chargegbt. So there were not, uh, no direct answers. We have to search for the answers. So the best way was all only you could get all the answers in the stack workflow. So this is how I overcame all the problems which I faced during the web screen. Thank you.\n'], [""Interviewer: It sounds like you've had some hands-on experience with web scraping and have a good understanding of the challenges that come with it, such as anti-bot measures like Cloudflare. Using Selenium is a common approach for handling dynamic content, but have you also worked with any other libraries or tools specifically designed for web scraping, such as Beautiful Soup or Scrapy? And how did you ensure that your scraping activities were ethical and legal?  \n"", ""Interviewee: I have used the beautiful soup for scraping. I have not used scrappy. I have used beautiful soup. Beautiful soup is also good, but it is not for the dynamic website. It's only usable for the static website. So for for dynamic website, so I have to move for the selenium part selenium. So regarding the epic ethics, so there are some fine lines when you are collecting the data. So you should not cross those limits. So if it is in the limits, then it is fine. It's because your web web web browser and web service is free for everyone, so anyone can gain the data. So it is not restricted that you should not, uh, take the data from the websites. So, uh, you are free to do anything with the web data. You you, uh, you search or you find it. Anything you can do. But there is a limit. There is a silver lining between the ethical and nonethical parts. So you should not cross those things. So you have to keep in mind that, uh, while scraping the data, is this data publicly available? Is this data, uh, available for everyone? It is not for a particular only for me or only for particular people group of people. So you have to be careful regarding that. And, also, you have to look into the concerns like which company are you going to and what is this data. Is this the company's related data or it is the general profitably available data, or it's the leaked data? If it is a leaked data, then you should definitely not work on with it because it is already breached, and you will also be breaching the ethical contents in that. Thank you.\n""], [""Interviewer: You've given a thoughtful response on the ethical considerations of web scraping. It's clear you understand the importance of respecting the terms of service and the public availability of data. Shifting gears a bit, I noticed you've worked with Django. Can you describe a project where you used Django and how you implemented features like user authentication or data modeling in your application?  \n"", ""Interviewee: I have used Django mainly for 2 projects. So one is my personal projects. Uh, I have worked on a personal project like bookstore management, where I I have made a online bookstore where you can buy or purchase the books, all those things. So for the authentication in this one, in the particular, uh, this in the bookstore man bookstore management project, I use the inbuilt Java authentication function. So with the basic username and password stored in it, we'll be storing all the password with the hashing function, and it will be stored. And with the Django's inbuilt authentication function, I used to authenticate. And another project I worked on, it was in the internship project. So I can say it was like an, uh, finance based company, which project I'm was working on. So there I have worked with Django. The, uh, and there, the authentication part was done based on the OTP. We're generating the tokens. We are generating a of tokens, and then we use it was valid for the particular amount of time. If you enter the token validly in the web browser, then it will allow you to work further with the website. So regarding the model building, yeah, Django the for the model building, Django is one of the best and easiest methods for easily handling data between different apps. So, you know, as the Django works based on applications or app set of apps, you can, uh, differentiate into, uh, different apps. So if it's a big project, you can divide it into separate separate apps. And each each apps has its own model. So you have to think about, uh, building a model search that the model in particular app must not conflict with another application. So model building, uh, those things are very necessary during the the developing of model. So you have to look into that. And another thing, like, uh, Django has given us the free, uh, independence to take the primary key or unique key. We can anything. So you are the given the full authority to work with it. So you have to build a web, uh, data or model search that it is not conflicting with any other model as well as it is not conflicting with any other applications with it. Thank you.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's great to hear about your experience with Django, especially how you've implemented different authentication methods and handled data modeling within the framework. The use of OTP for authentication adds a layer of security, which is quite important in e-commerce and finance-related projects. Since you've also mentioned working with JavaScript and React, can you discuss how you've integrated a Django backend with a React frontend in any of your projects, and what challenges you might have faced during that integration?  \n"", ""Interviewee: React integration part. So I'm going to say that, uh, React, I'm basically, uh, Django is used for API API, uh, development. So and with the use of express, I used to, uh, connect to the API. So all these, uh, connect integration of the React front end and the Django back end were done through the APIs. So I used to integrate the particular API using the express routing methods of express. So I used to, uh, access those data, and I was used to work with those things. Thank you.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you understand the role of APIs in connecting the frontend and backend. Using Express to handle the API requests is a common approach. Could you elaborate on how you structured your API endpoints in Django and how you ensured that the data flow between the frontend and backend was efficient and secure? Additionally, how did you handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues that might arise when making requests from a React frontend to a Django backend?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Regarding the the for express, I'll the the endpoints regarding the endpoints. So during the API creation in the Django itself, we are for each application, like, if it is a sales or invoice or it is a purchase purchase, uh, related applications, So then I would create a separate endpoint for each of the applications. So if it is a sales letter, then I would put all the sales related, uh, part in the sales endpoints. So in in the sales endpoints, uh, in the sales part, there are so many other sub endpoints. Like, in the sales there, we can find the invoices, slips, purchases, orders, those things. And under the purchases, there are many other things. So this is how I used to manage all the different endpoints together. And so how I, uh, how I did the authentication part with the Chorus. So in the Django, there is a part for Chorus where we can directly implement Chorus for authentication purpose. So understanding that it is the user, uh, authentic, uh, user is perfect, and it is being used with a different data while sharing. So and regarding the data sharing in the cross platform, it was a bit difficult for me in the first because, uh, React, I have not must work earlier before. I mostly worked on the back end part, so it was a bit challenging for me as I had got the help from my, uh, friend with most of the React, uh, any doubts I had with the React, I used to ask him. So he was he he's a friend in developer, and we used to, uh, he used to, uh, show me the path for how to work with the React. So regarding the power data, uh, uh, using of the data in the cross platform, so I used to request the API. The API would use to give us the answer response in the the JSON format. And in the JSON, there are all the datas which I require required. So using the JavaScript, I used to transfer all the required data only the required data which I have to show in the particular, uh, states or particular who who using the states and notes, I used to transfer the data. So dynamically loading websites, uh, has to dynamically load all the data based on the data which we receive. So I used to do this.\n""], [""Interviewer: You've provided a comprehensive explanation of how you've structured your API endpoints in Django and managed CORS using the built-in Django CORS headers. It's also good to hear that you've leveraged JSON responses and state management in React to efficiently handle data flow. Given your experience with both backend and frontend technologies, how do you approach testing in your full-stack applications? Can you describe your experience with any testing frameworks or strategies you've used to ensure the reliability of your code?  \n"", ""Interviewee: So regarding the testing, uh, I'll I'm I'm going to be honest that I'm not, uh, I don't know much about the testing part because, uh, in the internship, uh, my the testing part used to be looked after by the testers. So in the internship, there was nothing testing related to work with me. But for my particular, uh, my own personal process, I used to do the testing. So regarding the front end front end, I have also used Selenium testing. Selenium automation for testing purposes, like how the click is the click working or is the clicks are being rendered or is the alignment of the, uh, elements are particular orderly aligned or not. Those things I use Selenium for the testing. And regarding the features of the, uh, back end API, I used to test with the Django's, uh, testing. Uh, in Django, there is a particular part for testing itself. So I used to put all the dummy data into those in the test for the test file test dotpy file. I used to pass the test to dummy data, and using using those things, I used to verify the APIs.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's understandable that your testing experience might be more limited, especially with the focus on development during your internships. However, it's good to know that you've at least had some exposure to testing with Selenium for frontend and Django's built-in testing framework for backend. As you continue to develop your skills, testing will become an important aspect, especially for full-stack developers. For now, let's pivot to your experience with state management in React. Can you discuss how you've managed state in your React applications, and have you used any state management libraries or context API for this purpose?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Uh, regarding this, the state management. Uh, I will not use any other libraries for the state management. Uh, I only work with, uh, because it was my my own mini personal project where where I use the React. So, uh, there, uh, you only use the JavaScript, React state management or React inbuilt state management where I used to pass the data. So states are like you can't directly change the data, uh, in state by using the new you yeah. Sorry. You can't directly change the values in React. So if you want to change something or you have you can't increment the value directly. So you have to use the state for those things. So if, like, I'm going to increase the rate of the books or in the in my bookstore management project, if I'm going to increase the rates or increase the price of a book, then I use the states to do it because I can't directly increment the price based on the, um, based on the discounts. I can't directly I can't directly increment it. So I am going I I use the states that reacts in built state management, uh, to increment the values.\n""], [""Interviewer: Using React's built-in state management is a solid approach, especially for smaller applications. It's good to hear that you understand the importance of immutability in React state updates. As you've worked on a dynamic local marketplace website, can you tell me more about how you handled the data flow in this application? Specifically, how did you manage the data for the products, user interactions, and the shopping cart? Did you use any specific patterns or techniques to keep the data flow efficient and maintainable?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Regarding the data flow from, uh, shopping, uh, shopping to the shopping cart and to the checkout, so what I have done is, like, I used created a separate model for the carts carts and the orders. So what are the the uh, carts is separate and order is separate. Cards are cards in the cards, the elements which he has put into the cards are only stored. So using those things, I used to manage the cards elements separately and the ordered element separately. So from the cart, if you place the order, then only the elements from the cart will be moved to the orders orders, or else it will be in the cart itself so that the, uh, it may not conflict with the already shipped order or not ordered parts. So this is how I manage the data flow with the shopping carts. So, uh, using, uh, directly sending the data from the back end, I used to do, Like, if you if you select a particular item, then the ID of the item from the normal home page, the each book each book element has a particular letter ID to it. So the ticked I uh, the selected item's ID will be transferred to the next part. So based on the ID, I you based on the ID, I used to locate the book as well as its details like pricing, its author, its availability, store number of stocks. Those I used to check. And in the order list, I used to keep all those data. And if the order is available, uh, I mean, it's not out of stock, then it can be, uh, from the cart, it can be moved into if he is going to purchase, it can be moved. If it is out of stock, then in the web page itself, it will show us that if the quantity is less than 1, then it is showing it it is not in the market right now. So we have, uh, I manage those things. If it is in the stock or not, I used to manage with those things. So, uh, the data how did I add the data? So for my project, uh, I had to so it was not feasible to add all the, uh, hundreds of the 50 to 100 of books manually. So I implemented the scraping over here to add all the data to the my database. So I used the selenium here. I used the Sapna Bookhouse, uh, website for book reference, and from there, I used to scrape the book data along with the, uh, I'll scrape, uh, book name, book author name, and, uh, book name, author name, and publication dates, and publishers. Those things I used to scrape, and the price also yeah. Price also I used to scrape, but the price I have given my custom prices for for my reference over there. So these five things I used to scrape and I have to store in the database. This is how I store the data in the database. Regarding the, uh, number of available products, I used to write manually. Since this was a mini project, I, uh, each books were of only 5 5 limit 5 limited stocks itself. Only 5 limited stocks. So, uh, each book was 5 limited stocks. So if anyone orders a particular from the cart, it is ordered. If it is in the cart, then it can also be sold out. If it is not ordered, it can be sold out. So if someone orders from cart, it if the product is moved from cart to the orders, then only the, uh, quantity of the product will be reduced, or else it won't be reduced. So these were used to manage both the data, uh, element flowing from, uh, web page to the orders.\n""], [""Interviewer: You've outlined a clear strategy for managing the data flow in your marketplace application, using separate models for the cart and orders to maintain transactional integrity. The use of web scraping to populate your database with book data is a clever way to automate the process and ensure your marketplace has a comprehensive inventory. It's also good to see that you've implemented stock management logic to handle product availability. Given your experience with web scraping and data management, how do you ensure the consistency and accuracy of the scraped data, and what measures do you take to handle any changes in the source website's structure that might affect your scraping process?  \n"", ""Interviewee: When we whenever we are building a scraping model, the most difficult situation is for for us is that if the website has been updated or if, uh, changes in the webs website has been done. So this this thing cannot be, uh, completely automated. So we have to constantly check the website for if, uh, regarding if you have to constantly monitor the website. If there are even a slight changes, like only the class names are changed, if the element's class names are changed, IDs are changed, those things can be easily implemented because we store all the important x path or the parallel elements, uh, elements, class name, path name, path ID name, all are stored in a separate variable, required variable so that if in the in the future, if anything changes related to particular element, I can easily, uh, copy the path of that particular element and store in that particular variable. So by doing this, most of the code remains same. Only the, uh, thing that is changing is only the x path or the path of the element. So this is how I manage the automation. So but even though after doing that, we have to constantly monitor the website, like, uh, 2 weekly ones, 2 week uh, if it is not of, uh, big big big website like LinkedIn or LinkedIn, we can monitor it, like, weekly once. If it is LinkedIn, then we have to do it weekly once at least weekly once. If it is, uh, other website, not such large websites, then we can do it monthly once. So we have to monthly once we have to monitor. If there are changes, then we have to pop up, find the particular path, and then we have to implement it.\n""], [""Interviewer: You've highlighted a key aspect of web scraping, which is the need for robust monitoring and adaptability to changes in the source website's structure. Storing selectors and paths in variables is a good practice for maintainability, and your approach to monitoring frequency is well-considered based on the size and frequency of updates to the website. To further understand your technical skills, let's talk about your experience with Python. Can you walk me through how you've used Python in your backend development, perhaps in the context of your Django projects, and how you've leveraged its features for efficient and secure application development?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah, sure. So Django is basically a python framework for backend. So everything you write for about by core is written in the python itself. So in the similar way how we use JavaScript for normally for backend purposes in node.js similar. The python does the same work python is a very vast language and it is a well well organized Community where everyone is contributing to it. So it is one of the best language which is present in all the fields it can handle AI domain it can handle web domain everything can be held in it in it. So during the back it's similarly how we are writing a python core it similarly it is in Django. But only the thing changes is like we have to create a models. We have structuring the structuring the code based on the particular Frameworks. So only those things are changing other than that all the basic python course Remains the Same so regarding the robustness of the Court. and usability of the court, I would say that like using the python the one of the most difficult situation is that it would take a lot of time like it is it is a bit time complexities with high for all the programming python programs compared to other C or C plus plus programs, but the memory management is good in Python. So the most important thing which we face is Time management. So for the time management, we can order always rely on those things. Like if the data comes then we can't so we have to be we have to be a synchronous. So we we can adapt to any changes if the based on the incoming output if the even if the incoming output is fast or slow due to the network errors, those things must be also handled. So by using async and a synchronous functions in Python, I used to handle those those things delay in that time. And other than that for error handling I used to use error handling methods try and try except methods for handling the errors because the dynamic applications we won't be able to understand. It there may be due to anything because it is dynamic website. So the real time in the real time data, there may be any unexpected any expected issues which we have previously not built for a program. So to handle all those things you I used try and I mean error handling methods to handle all those things as well as with the error handling. It's also difficult. I know because we won't be able to find all those things directly. So error handling must be in search will it we are able to understand and during a after the project has been developed. We decent already deployed and the devil of development and deployed face. It has already published at that time. We won't be able to monitor the console. So at those thing times we have to be. We have to use logs. So in the python, I used to use loggers logger modules to store all my logs in a particular log folders where I used to monitor if any error has been if any errors are there I used to add it to the log log and if it is a debug I used to specify it is an error message or a debug message so that I would be able to understand if it is due to error or it is to error the debug debug. So this is how I managed to understand during the Production environment, so and one more important thing is they are using python. So most of the time the browser doesn't understand the true or false because in Python that true or false is the true tea in the true is capital, but in the Json for JavaScript for format the team in the tourist small letter, so, okay, so these case Institute things. Must also be handled. So if I am rating a program in Python, then I must not use the I must not use the normal JavaScript true or false for Mac because I'm writing the code in Python. So I have to look into it. But before sending the data to the apis or to the front end users, I have to convert the Python structure data into the Json JavaScript structure data because I am going to send it to the other users in the web. The web won't understand the difference between capital D and small T. It is it is strict with the case sensitivity strict. So I have to understand and I have to change those things.

So we wanted to recommend, uh, the video courses in which the customer is most likely to convert or most likely to pay for our subscription plan. So I employed collaborative filtering, and, uh, it is a multistep process for payment. So I, uh, assign different steps of the payments as ratings that particular customer wants to pay for a particular, uh, series. So using collaborative filtering and assigning different steps, the incremental steps for, uh, rating system as, uh, as the different rating rating given by the customer to a particular series. Now when, uh, using, uh, and building the collaborative system, I check for its evaluation through CTR rate in which, uh, I was checking whether they recommend this recommended series top 5 recommended series for a particular customer.

Uh, so first of all, uh, to answer the first question where I am, uh, I am evaluating the, uh, incremental steps, uh, incremental payment steps as a rating system. So, uh, there were 4 different steps, uh, in which, uh, whether a customer which are whether a customer has visited a series page, whether whether a customer has initiated the payment, whether a customer has visited the payment, uh, bill gateway, made the payment and bought a subscription plan to us. So these are 4 different ratings that a that a particular user can, uh, like it is a proxy for for the payment steps, the rating system.

Uh, for for the cold start problem, I think, uh, my problem resolved revolved around the, uh, the new users only. So we had different campaigns to which, uh, uh, different campaign funnels, uh, and marketing campaign funnels through which we were receiving different kind of users. So based on the, uh, ideation of that campaign and based on the, uh, based on the designing of the campaign, we, uh, decided upon the target category for a particular customer. And, uh, we started recommendation engine for, uh, for new customers from those target categories. So new video courses from the target, uh, cat category of the campaign and, uh, like, the category of the series is. We use that to, uh, address the cold start problem. And specifically in collaborative filtering, I think, uh, I used a day t minus 1 data to see whether the customer has, uh, visited any, uh, series or checked for any payment step or went through any payment steps in a particular series, uh, we we can take those as the initial, rating given by the user, uh, as the payment steps.

Uh, uh, for this particular, uh, project, I did not use fine tuning the GPT, but rather I used prompt completion and prompt engineering techniques in which I used chain of thoughts and, uh, different reasoning steps to check for a particular to to check for the context uh, while answering a particular question about English grammar. And for for x for measuring the accuracy and relevancy of the answer generated by the, uh, by by by the chaining of prompts.

Can you explain how you've used MLflow for experiment tracking and model management in your projects, and specifically, any challenges you faced with its implementation in a production environment?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. Uh, I've used MLflow, uh, in tracking the experiments. While I was at CAS24, I was working on a damage detection system, which is an image based inspection system for cars damages.

So, uh, while doing, uh, while training all this model, uh, this was not an out of the box, uh, model which we we can use. So we use faster r CNN and mask r CNN while, uh, experimenting with different kind of data, with different, uh, datasets and different labeled datasets. Uh, we wanted to ensure that whatever hypothesis we are making during the experimentation, we, uh, are ensuring that we are aligned with the starting hypothesis and the evaluation evaluation measures or different statistical test tests that we'll have to do for a particular hypothesis.

So I use MLflow over there. Uh, as per technical challenges, I did not, uh, I do not remember as of now. Uh, there were a couple of challenges while, uh, while keeping the different data versions.

Given your experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch, could you discuss a scenario where you had to choose one framework over the other for a specific project, and what were the key factors that influenced your decision?  \n', 'Interviewee: Okay.

I have used TensorFlow and PyTorch in different projects, but, uh, there was one project where I preferred PyTorch over TensorFlow because a lot of new research area, uh, that comes up, they have their working, uh, or their demo code working into PyTorch since PyTorch is most prep more preferred by a researcher. So, uh, one experimental, uh, product that I was working on during Stylex, which was, uh, generating customized, uh, human selfies with different hairstyles. So, uh, for this particular project, uh, I think I used PyTorch and I preferred PyTorch because a lot of, uh, frameworks like style and w again, cycle again. These were available, uh, with with some initial implementation, which can be extended further into PyTorch only. So, uh, the reason, uh, I prefer PyTorch is something, uh, which is, like, more closer to research.

They are much more efficient in, uh, in producing tools which are more general or which which are more generalized in nature.

So regarding, uh, since we are talking about, uh, Amazon guidances, so I'm going with that thing only. So what happened there? Uh, the beta was up 2 types. Uh, they were up the 2 types. 1 was high confidence, and another was low confidence. High confidence means machine learning, uh, already answered by itself. However, regarding the low confidence, it was not confident to them to answer. So what happened there, uh, when we classified the these jobs into LC or HC, LC by means, uh, low confidence, HC means high confidence. And, uh, for example, in the PC, we are talking about PC. In case it did not provide it, uh, educate input. For example, an easy job was marked as l c or an l c, important job. It was parked as, uh, like, false negative.

And, uh, regarding the trade off between these two, so what happened, uh, mainly because some of the trimmed videos right there or empty videos right there, there was nothing going on in the videos that was the noise. We consider that as noise or trade off. So we usually used to fetch the data and check the little samples if something is there. If, uh, it was there, then we need to check the code or the machine since, uh, in Amazon, you do not need to code again and again. So you can understand it is all the tools running in the behind. You just have to test the data and do a little ETA or ETA and ETL, sorry, extract transform and load.

So regarding the false negative, since, uh, most as you told, you are very right. Most of the stakeholders, they don't have any technical knowledge what we were talking about. Right? Like, this is what we call our first negatives, first positives. So we have to tool them, uh, make them understand that, uh, look, uh, since, uh, during the data processing for example, if we use human for all the data, whether it is HCLC or anything, Uh, it will cost you millions because you have to employ a large number of people, and they should be well versed with the knowledge, but they'll see what is HCLC or to answer. So, uh, we want to make them understand, uh, how AI is helping us out in it. And we just, uh, provided a thought put for them. They're like, uh, what is a false positive? And what's a false negative? We told them that false positives, for example, if something is there and we tell that it is not there, it is a false negative, and we are already ignoring it. So that means we are missing an important input. So we are losing on data and it may not be accurate. So we have to be careful about the false negatives. Regarding the first positives, if it is there, for example, as something was there and we told that it is not there. Uh, sorry. It is there.

I will tell you how it so whatever working on a data and we found that Associates who processed the data in very low time.

Using KNN and pair plots for feature selection is a practical approach. When you say you considered all the features and then dropped some, how did you determine which features to drop? Also, how did you ensure that the model you implemented was both accurate and fair in its distribution of work among the associates?  \n"", ""Interviewee: It's John. Uh, since it is a confidential project, I will not go in-depth in it. But, uh, two features right there. As I already told you, the associates were getting for those who answered in the less time, they were getting easy easy workflow, and it was not very complex for them. And, uh, using that, they were in the top of their metrics because no one knew in the background, uh, using the these things that since they answered or, uh, processed the job in low time, they were getting less jobs. So we just fine tuned our Amazon client That's the real time. It was all, uh, real time data analysis there. So we had to fine tune it, and we just, uh, made sure that, uh, the lambda function is working correctly and, uh, using the input like shards and how they would deface the data from our stream. And, uh, it went uniformly, uh, to all of the associates. I under\n""], [""Interviewer: I understand the sensitivity of the project details. Focusing on the technical aspects, it's clear that you leveraged AWS services to ensure fair distribution of work. When you were working with Lambda functions and real-time data, how did you handle the monitoring and logging of these functions to ensure they were performing as expected? And in terms of model validation, what techniques did you use to test the fairness and accuracy of the workload distribution model you implemented?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes, John. Uh, I forgot to answer this in the previous question. I missed it out. Sorry for that. So regarding the, uh, fairness of this model, we just checked the f one score. And, uh, we also sometimes, uh, went to the model score using, uh, like, we take the model score from scikit learn. Because we for example, if we cross the data, there's a very large amount of data. We just took some little sample from it and then, uh, used the model score or Apple score for it. From then, we did the null hypothesis also. That is also a way of doing it, whether it is funding in the path or not. So regarding the Lambda function inside the Amazon Kinases, so, um, it was already predefined there. We have to do little change. Like, we have to adjust the time. And, uh, sometimes we used to, uh, go through the loops. For example, we, uh, use the conditional of our conditional modeling there and give it a function like, uh, while, uh, the associate answers this job, and then it should go again there, and it should be uniformed. The same job should not go there. And, like, uh, it was like first come, first serve reason. Like, easy jobs who are processing the jobs in little time. He's getting all the easy jobs and getting the admin addresses, and that was not fair like that. No problem.\n""], [""Interviewer: No problem, and thank you for clarifying. Using the F1 score and model scoring from scikit-learn are good measures for assessing model performance. It's also reassuring to hear that you considered the null hypothesis to ensure the model's predictions were statistically significant. For the Lambda functions, it's clear you had to tailor them to meet the specific needs of workload distribution. Can you elaborate on how you implemented the conditional logic within the Lambda functions to ensure fair distribution, and what kind of testing or simulation you performed to validate that the new logic was working as intended?  \n"", ""Interviewee: John, uh, when we reported this anomaly to our, uh, I'm reporting to the manager and he reported to them as stakeholders or whoever was in the background he, uh, reporting to. So, uh, but in the testing mode, uh, we'll just place the data. And, uh, in the Amazon guide system, the Lambda function, we adjust the time flow. Like, uh, when we assign a pair to our that associates were getting the easy job flow. We're answering it in the little time. So we had to adjust that because it was just going 1st come, 1st serve basis. Whoever is answering and the little time is getting the easy ones. So we just made a distribution there, like, uh, using the central limit theorem. For example, if it is not a good distribution there, if it is not uh, symmetrical distribution, we use the, uh, central limit in the normal cases. Why, uh, however, in there, we use the while while loops there. For example, while the associate is answering the job in the less time, we should still get the, uh, same complexity, complexity, uh, as the other ones are getting. And once we implemented that in the, uh, Firehouse Amazon Kinetic, we just took this, uh, little data from there and checked ourselves whether it is working fine or not. So similarly, we went on with model score. If it was 95% and above since it was very easy, it should be 95% and above. So we just implemented it like that. Implementing\n""], [""Interviewer: Implementing a fair distribution system using the central limit theorem and while loops within the Lambda functions is a clever solution to ensure equal workload complexity for associates. It's also good to hear that you performed manual checks to validate the system's performance. Given the complexity of this task, how did you ensure that the system remained scalable and efficient as the workload increased? And what kind of automated testing or monitoring did you put in place to catch any regressions in the workload distribution?  \n"", ""Interviewee: John, regarding the complete, uh, complexity and the regression thing which you're asking, how we have monitored that? So first of all, I will go with the distributions. So I will make you understand, uh, the job flow was same. It was not different. So for example, if there are a 100 jobs in the queue, consider the video as jobs. I'm telling that, uh, there were 100 jobs in the queue. So what was getting, uh, if what was happening if there is a set a and a set b, Uh, if associate a answers the job in the less time, uh, so I repeated it many times, you will get the easy one. So when I use the Lambda function, what happens, they are the same under jobs by uniformly distributed. For example, if, uh, an, uh, a machine predicts an LC and it is very, uh, critical. Uh, for example, if there are a 100 LCs and the the total job flow is 200 jobs, so it will divide 50 ML 1 and 50 50 ML, other associate. So regarding the fairness of this, uh, in background, we employed the k nearest neighbors and we checked, um, this thing whether if it is going uniformly across all the associates or not. So groups right there, and we face the data from the clusters. It's cleared.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into ensuring that the workload is evenly distributed among associates. Using KNN for clustering and ensuring that the system remains scalable is a good approach. To further understand the scalability of your solution, could you discuss how you handled the dynamic nature of the workload? For instance, how did your system adapt to sudden spikes in the number of jobs in the queue, and what measures did you put in place to ensure that the system could handle an increasing number of associates or jobs without significant performance degradation?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Yes, John, that was a very good question because I have faced this values. So what happens I already told you it is regarding the videos which were loading in the background Associates have to answer them or the process them. So sometimes the workflow increase at your rightly mentioned. So in those cases, we always have a backup Associates because the same number of SSS can also work on this data, but we cannot delete or drop some data from the input so that there is a loss to the company or whatever we are working there is lost to the crosses. So we have a backup amount of associated with in the different processes, but they were trained on this process all so in case there is a sentence Spike we used to get the input from the key and and which is already there. He that processes that can and there is also Amazon quicksight quicksight Q. Basically we use it that also showed that there is a number of backlog or we are missing out this number of data or slee and accordingly if we need more Associates, we took the associates and they were the hands on the system. However, sometimes what happens the jobs were processing being repeatedly, so that was one concern. It happens sometimes ridiculous or something. We also had to address that and remote using the lasting approach.\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

Yes.\n'], ['Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you have a strong background in front-end development. Can you tell me about a particularly challenging project you led and how you utilized your skills in React and Next.js to overcome that challenge?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So one of the latest project I worked on was, um, SDKs at Stream IO. SDK that we've built was audio and video SDK with WebRTC. So, basically, this software development kit is, uh, meant for people that have React or React Native app. They would like to have an audio or video or chat functionality. That's something that we developed from scratch. Um, and, yeah, it's, uh, it's more difficult than, uh, that what it sounds like with chat functionality, for example. Uh, we have struggled about with a lot of bidirectional scrolling, stuff like that, things that are still premature with React Native, and constantly trying to improve and, uh, yeah, make sure that the performance is is top notch. And also offline support was a thing with chat and activity feeds, making sure that everything stays top notch and, um, basically users can use those, you know, those cloud components of chat messages and, uh, and their channels while, uh, while being offline. So that was a cool feature I've worked on.\n""], ['Interviewer: That sounds like a complex and innovative project. Bi-directional scrolling and offline support are indeed challenging features. Could you elaborate on how you approached implementing offline support in React Native, and what strategies or tools you used to ensure a seamless user experience when the network connection was lost?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So first of all, we needed to ensure that we recognize when the network is lost. Uh, so you can achieve this by using 3rd party libraries. When the connection is lost, uh, yeah, you want to ensure that, uh, actually, before that, when the app starts, you want to ensure to basically persist all of the state that you have in in that aspect that was channels and their messages, all of the conversation and their messages, persist this into the database. We were using their the SQLite database on the on the machine on the iOS or Android device. We've done this with Watermelon DB, uh, which is ORM, uh, which makes, you know, you know, SQLite writing easier. So we persisted the channels and then when the connection fell, um, we had the channels and the messages and the reactions and the threads, etcetera, etcetera. And when the user became or the device become online again, uh, we sort of, uh, we had an endpoint where we could sort of synchronize, uh, all of the new events that happened since being offline until being online again, uh, sort of sort of to catch up, persisting everything in the database again and making sure that everything is available. So that was really, really cool. That had also other effects, uh, because the discussions, the channels, and the messages were there before a new one, you know, were loaded. So the start up the start up time, the boot time of the, you know, of the devices of the of the of the channels and the discussions on the chats themselves were were also faster 2 d eyes. So so the UX UI was, uh, indeed better. So that was quite complex, uh, but eventually achieved it.\n""], [""Interviewer: Impressive use of Watermelon DB and SQLite for local data persistence. It's clear you've thought through the synchronization process well. Shifting focus a bit, I noticed you've also worked with TypeScript. Can you discuss how TypeScript has benefited your development process, particularly in the context of the projects you've worked on?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So the last project that I've worked on is still under NDA, uh, but it was a sort of a social social social networking app. That's where we benefited a lot from patch. It basically saved us a lot of times. I really believe myself in in testing. Otherwise, the users will do it. And in the pyramid of testings, the the first step is the static code testing. And this all of this type, you know, this, uh, type, uh, making sure that you're typed aware, uh, aligned with types. We we really saved our a lot of times. We have few issues on production that, uh, in the past when we were with JavaScript and after we comparing it to the time that we, you know, did we migrate TypeScript, uh, saved us a lot. So we saw a decrease of, um, yeah, of issues that occurred. This this this type safety is something that became, uh, an, you know, an industry industry standard and, uh, really, really helped me, uh, professionally, uh, a lot of times. And, uh, it became the the standard in the industry at the moment. So love working with TypeScript and sort of like a lot of people says that it makes you slower, but I think it's like, it might slow you down. But, uh, in the long run, you know, you have more software that is, you know, more reliant, more scalable, and more, yeah, more resilient to to issues and bugs. So big fan of that.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's great to hear how TypeScript has enhanced your development process, especially in terms of reducing production issues and improving code quality. Given your experience with both front-end and back-end technologies, how do you ensure that your TypeScript types are consistent across the full stack, and could you give an example of how you've used TypeScript to share types between a Next.js front-end and a Node.js back-end?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. It is something that I've done in the past on a project called Salute AI. It's basically sort of copilot for recruiters throughout the recruitment processes from start to finish. Um, and it was built with Next. Js, Basically, the Olmern, uh, stack. There, we have typescript, uh, that helped us. On on based on the typescript, we've basically based on open open AI and open API specs, we generated the typescript for the front end, and therefore, you know, we ensured that everything is aligned. So everything started with the back end and, uh, you know, the typescript there that has been shared throughout the back end and the front end project. And also the the open API spec that, you know, from from JSON, we could generate the types and the interfaces and really, really helped us there to to have everything connected. So that was cool.\n""], [""Interviewer: Leveraging OpenAPI specifications to generate TypeScript types is a smart approach for maintaining consistency between the front-end and back-end.

Now, considering your experience with React Native, how do you handle the differences in platform capabilities and limitations when developing cross-platform applications, and could you share how you've addressed a particularly challenging cross-platform issue in one of your projects?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. This this is an ongoing thing. I think with Android is is way more difficult because there are more Android devices over iOS devices. Uh, there are always shortcomings when you develop, uh, you know, a certain feature on React Native. Uh, I think mainly is testing, making sure that the app is testable and that the tools that you're using are tested correctly throughout multiple devices. It could be done by a QA team. My favorite is automated end to end testing, uh, uh, on real devices on the device farm where you can test everything, you know, against 2 to 3, you know, Android devices with different Android, uh, versions and same goes for iOS. Either\n""], [""Interviewer: It's good to hear that you value automated end-to-end testing and have experience with tools like Device Farm. Can you describe a specific instance where automated testing helped you catch a critical issue that might have been missed with manual testing, and how you integrated this testing into your development workflow?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So, um, we had a had a an app with a lot of screens in it and a lot of sort of, you know, UI, UX flows. And we discovered the crash, uh, with end to end testing. We have been using MySQL for the end to end testing in CICD with MySQL Cloud. Uh, so every time creating a, you know, cutting a release, this has been running automatically. And we saw that there was a crash there. So the test did fail. The tests, uh, have failed. And what happened, we've, uh, we we halted the the process and and really prevent us from releasing an an app with a with a crush on it. So it's nice to have it in CICD.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a great example of how automated end-to-end testing can be a lifesaver in catching critical issues before they reach production. Using Maestro for CI/CD and having tests run on every release is a solid strategy for maintaining app stability. Given your experience with CI/CD and automated testing, how do you approach the balance between maintaining a fast development cycle and ensuring thorough testing, especially in the context of a rapidly evolving project?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. I think always with balance, making sure, you know, the pyramid of test, we spoke about it, that you have a lot of static testing, app through TypeScript, and then have, uh, more unit tests, uh, you know, your business logics, integration tests for, you know, the components itself and how all the functions are working seamlessly together and then on top of it, a little bit of end to end testing. It does take time to test end to end testing and it is costly on, you know, on CICD. Therefore, making sure that you, you know, test the main flows and the things that are intensively, uh, that the work to test it with throughout the QA team is intensive. But, otherwise, try to test it via QA team or do it yourself. So always approach this with balance.\n'], ['Interviewer: Absolutely, the testing pyramid is a sound strategy for balancing speed and quality in the development process. Focusing on unit tests for business logic, integration tests for components, and selective end-to-end tests for critical paths is a wise approach.

Good question. So, yeah, you can use every CICD. Uh, yeah, you need to make sure that your CICD is not only mobile specific like Bitrise, uh, but you can use I love using GitHub actions and, yeah, making sure that you do things parallelly where possible.

Yeah, that's it.\n""], [""Interviewer: It sounds like you've implemented a robust CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, Vercel for front-end deployment, and contract testing with OpenAPI specs for the back-end. The use of Cypress for end-to-end testing and the integration of checks to ensure both the front-end and back-end are in sync before deployment is a solid approach.

Can you elaborate on a specific instance where you identified a performance bottleneck in a React or React Native application and the steps you took to address it?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So we had a React Native app with a very, very big list of sort of, uh, of blog posts with an animation in it. Uh, and a lot of the time, you know, the list after scrolling and scrolling became more and more slower. We ensured that we memorize what needs to be memorized there. We approached the the, uh, basically, we implemented the the React Native standards of, you know, big flat list, memorization where needed, and the results were immense. Um, so, So basically, pagination there was added. So don't don't, you know, load thousands of logs if you don't need them. Always load, you know, another page, another page while scrolling down. Yeah. Window size, uh, of the item itself and, yeah, and basically testing throughout certain certain, uh, devices and also making sure that, um, you're not rendering something that is not in the view. So if it's outside of the view of the device, we're just not rendering it. That really helped us.\n""], [""Interviewer: Implementing memoization and using FlatList with pagination are excellent strategies for handling large datasets in React Native. It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into optimizing the rendering process to maintain performance. Testing on various devices is also a smart way to ensure cross-device compatibility.

So I worked on various projects for example, Coastal link app food ordering app. So I have used different Technologies react node. Typescript JavaScript. Next year's monk for database mongodb postgres SQL and I have experienced in cicd Pipeline and also understanding about Docker and I worked on graph. graphql and also Prisma orm so Currently I'm working as a freelancer. and I'm working on one project called core selling app mainly using react as frontend node as backend using typescript and in Turbo repo framework and\n""], [""Interviewer: That's quite a diverse journey.

And regarding embedded systems, uh, we were working in secured environment where we don't, uh, it's not a distributed software. The software is installed on in the secured place on the in secured, uh, CPUs. So it's not, uh, so it's not a problem there, but here, uh, because the software is distributed and, uh, also, uh, connected to different clients, uh, and servers.

So, uh, on turbo repo, I put everything on the admin client side code and also admin side code and also, uh, the client side code on the same repo. Whatever components for example, login, uh, component, it is same for both, uh, for admin and also for, uh, client. So the common components, I have put it in something called UI.

Could you elaborate on the specific AWS services or features you've utilized to enhance the application's scalability and reliability?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. So, uh, one thing, uh, I have used their load balancing and also the replication, uh, because if one server is down, the traffic will go to another server. And, also, if traffic is, uh, more, it will, uh, it will create the 3rd server and take that divert that traffic to, uh, to the 3rd server. So here, uh, the availability system availability is better, and, also, the failure rate is less.

Now, let's delve into the technical skills listed on your resume. Starting with Next.js, could you explain how you've utilized server-side rendering (SSR) in a Next.js application to improve performance, and what considerations you've had to make in terms of data fetching and caching?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So so next year's, uh, I have used for, uh, to do list one app. Uh, so in this case, both client side and also server side software, I have written at the same place.

So, um, if I want to render, uh, at the server side, uh, I should not if I want to render at the client side, I have to, uh, at the starting of the file, I have to give use client, then it will render, uh, the client side. Otherwise, it will render it, uh, server side. So, uh, because, uh, of Next JS architecture and all server side rendering features, uh, it optimizes SEO searching and, um, the performance is better. Initially, we feel the it's little, uh, there is a delay, but, um, in in the rendering starting of, uh, the application. But the profile it gives very good performance.\n""], ['Interviewer: Your explanation highlights the strategic use of Next.js for both client and server-side rendering, emphasizing the balance between SEO optimization and initial load performance. Given this dual nature of rendering, how do you approach code splitting in Next.js to ensure that only the necessary code is sent to the client, thereby optimizing client-side performance?  \n', 'Interviewee: Yeah. So, um, we need to decide, uh, what components need to be rendered, uh, at server side, what components need to be render rendered at client side. Uh, so first, we need to decide that. And, uh, one more thing, uh, that, uh, wherever we use, uh, hooks, those particular components, we can render only at client side.

How do you handle data fetching and state management in these scenarios, especially considering the potential complexities of managing state in a server-side rendered environment?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So wherever there is a state management and wherever there is a data fetching from API, uh, those components, uh, we we have to initialize at the bottom of the file as use client. Those things we need to be rendered, uh, on client side, not at the server side. So, uh, uh, and that's the way we have to do. And, uh, state management also comes under hooks. So state management also, uh, we have to do at client side.\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to leveraging hooks for both data fetching and state management, specifically to target client-side rendering, is a thoughtful strategy. Shifting focus to a different skill, could you explain how you've integrated TypeScript into your Node.js backend for the course selling app, particularly in terms of enhancing code quality and developer productivity?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Uh, so for for Node. Js, I have to install TypeScript. Then, uh, I what I have to do, I have to for all the inputs, I have to give type. Uh, for example, if I have a, uh, post API, uh, API endpoint, uh, for all the inputs for request and response, I have to give, uh, the type. So because I am, uh, giving the type for all the input parameters as a developer, I'll not mistake, uh, giving wrong, uh, type input. Yeah. That's the way, uh, I have developed, uh, TypeScript, uh, in Node. Js. We just have to give\n""], [""Interviewer: Your emphasis on using TypeScript for input parameter type checking to catch errors early is a solid practice for enhancing code reliability. How have you leveraged TypeScript's features, such as interfaces or custom types, to further structure and organize your backend code in the course selling app?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. So, uh, I have, uh, one interface called, uh, course. So, uh, it has, uh, it has the data like, uh, it it has the parameters like, uh, course title, course description, course price, course, uh, whether it is published or not, and also the path for video or, uh, image path, um, and also video link, uh, it has. So what I have to do, first, I have to give this interface. Uh, I have to, uh, define interface, uh, for course. And, um, in my Node JS, uh, server application, uh, this particular particular interface I have to assign to the data variable, uh, to, uh, codes to the codes course state. Um, I will not say state. Uh, the parameter course, I have to assign this type course.\n'], ['Interviewer: Your use of interfaces in TypeScript to define the structure of the ""course"" object and enforce that structure throughout your Node.js application is a great example of how TypeScript can enhance code clarity and reliability. How do you ensure that the TypeScript compiler\'s strict mode, which enforces additional type checking, is effectively utilized in your project to catch potential issues early in the development cycle?  \n', 'Interviewee: Yeah. Yes. So, uh, there is a file called tsconfigfile. In that, uh, we have to define all the parameters related to TypeScript. For example, where my, um, the compiled JS files need to be stored. For example, this folder where we want to be to be stored. And also, there is one more parameter as you mentioned, strict. Uh, if we make this strict as true, then, uh, TypeScript will check for all the type errors. And as developer writes code, it will give errors. The data is undefined and the the given parameter is string. You are giving the number. So by making strict, uh, parameter true, we can, uh, make sure, uh, the the type proper types for all the inputs.\n'], [""Interviewer: Configuring the tsconfig file to enable strict mode is indeed a crucial step in leveraging TypeScript's full potential for type safety and error prevention.

Can you describe a particularly challenging SEO problem you encountered at White Glove Financial and how you solved it?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Our goal at White Glove Financial was to write new content that would live inside of a platform and, uh, that we had built. And, uh, actually, we had acquired it. We had acquired it from another company, but then we were refining it for our needs. Uh, the company was, uh, the the goal of the company was for financial advisors to stay in touch with clients and recruit new business. And, uh, one of the ways to do that is basically to be introducing topics to people that were, um, that were sufficiently interesting and but would also lead to the conclusion that they could not master the subject themselves. They had to speak to a financial adviser. So what we did was we would have content that lived on our own platform, but we would share it on social media. And I would say the challenge with Facebook social media is, first of all, just from a back end standpoint, they are skeptical of platforms like ours, so we really had to be rigorous in conforming to their, um, their proprietary standards, um, because if you were too boring, uh, in your in any aspect of your content, it would not share that content widely, and it was really working against what we were trying to do for those financial advisors. So suffice to say that that that course that position required a crash course in Facebook SEO in particular, uh, now Meta, but we weren't really primarily using Instagram as much as we were trying to use Facebook because we recognized that that was more in line with where the customer base primarily was interacting on social media.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's interesting how you tailored the content to not only be engaging but also to drive a specific action. Given the challenges with Facebook's algorithm and standards, can you elaborate on some of the specific strategies or techniques you found most effective in ensuring your content was both engaging and compliant with their standards?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. I would say the way to do that within Facebook is that you're essentially just answering line by line as you probably know, um, both, uh, a subject title and then an article title. And so what you would do was, of course, you'd have the article title be something that would be outward facing and engaging. But then sort of the subject title would be, uh, basically a keyword rich thing that Facebook would recognize, um, as something that should be shared widely if someone was, uh, the type of person who was reading, for example, a lot of financial information on Facebook or even the Wall Street Journal, for example, we recognize. Those are the types of people who, um, were, you know, a big part of our demographic. Because the whole point of the financial advisor situation is that you are trying to get people to realize they don't know enough about a subject. And on that end, ultimately, um, while the content was while the goal of the content was this was definitely to be clear, It was also to emphasize the many pitfalls of trying to manage financial, uh, advice and, uh, management of one's portfolio by oneself. So the the goal was definitely not to be, um, muddy, but it was essentially to communicate the the the the crucial importance of getting these decisions right and how also how much of a relief it is when those decisions have been outsourced to someone who is ostensibly a professional because essentially, the financial advisor's pitch is that you don't, um, you know, you don't get get into a limousine with someone who's never driven before, and if you've never driven before yourself, you don't just get behind the wheel of a car and start driving. Um, and and ultimately that, um, while on a surface level, financial decisions are simple from the standpoint of just investing in index funds has has been the operative wisdom for 20 to 30 years. There are also so many decisions underneath, uh, retirement investing. For example, um, management of one's home and estate, education saving and spending, etcetera, um, and then the tax implications of all that that one should be thinking about. And and the goal was to emphasize how a holistic approach like that is so much more advantageous than just thinking, oh, I'm gonna buy um, whatever index fund at a regular price and blah blah blah, and that's all I need to do to be in a good situation financially.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to content framing and targeting is quite strategic. Shifting back to the technical side, could you explain how you approached the technical aspects of SEO, such as on-page optimization or site structure, to ensure the content you were creating for the financial advisors' platform was not only engaging but also highly discoverable by search engines?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Although I think I've kind of done that a few times, but I I guess basically, uh, when you're working, uh, in the back end in meta and you are it it in some part, this was a collaboration with with the, uh, people who had built the platform that we were then using at White Glove, which was, um, which, as I said, was proprietary, but would also allow financial advisors to not only share content via social media, but also keep track of their clients and prospects. It was basically one big dashboard. So, uh, but that the some of the decisions about how to optimize, uh, and get plugged in directly to Facebook and what they needed were being handled by the back end developing people who, uh, who were a separate team, and I was not necessarily a part of that team. They did ask me what what they would love to from me would and I was very simple in my response, which is just, hey. We need, um, we need stuff that looks professional, and we need stuff that looks like it's coming from the Wall Street Journal and other, uh, outlets that people trust because we just don't wanna look like, well, a very bad version of NerdWallet, for example. Um, so but but I will say that, uh, the most of the decisions for how to optimize, um, from a digital standpoint were, uh, were being handled by the back end development team because the goal was not to go viral on Facebook necessarily. The goal was to be much more, uh, personal and and informative and not really trying for fireworks, but really trying to simply just look professional and those that required, um, just building a system that talked to Facebook and answered all the questions and and looked like it was a professional outlet.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you had a strong focus on the user experience and the credibility of the content. Given your role in ensuring the content's professionalism and trustworthiness, how did you collaborate with the development team to maintain a balance between the visual and functional aspects of the platform, especially in terms of SEO considerations?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, the platform was I there's a little bit of a lack of overlap here because the SEO considerations were, um, you know, but they were basically internally handled. And then when it came but when it came to actually, uh, the design of the of the interface itself, um, that it was important that financial advisers would have an easy time navigating that because those were our direct clients. Uh, we weren't dealing with people who were trying to reach financial advisers. We were dealing with financial advisers and and those people can be quite conservative in in their approach. So I would say the the abundance of focus was placed on simply having an easy to use professional looking sort of Charles Schwabbe type interface that, uh, the type of people who were our direct clients, which as I mentioned, were very conservative, basically mid market and small market financial professionals who were just trying to grow their business from 5 to 7 to 9 to 13. Uh, they could be sharing content on Facebook that was not just, hey, I'm a financial advisor, come talk to me, but was professional looking, um, and also, um, and also content that they could trust and that and that emphasize the right content goals, which is let's just get people in the door and start having a conversation regardless of where they're at in life, and especially if they're at a turning point in life, like getting their first job, getting married, etcetera.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's interesting to see how the focus on user experience and trustworthiness extended to the platform's design and functionality. Given the conservative nature of the target audience, how did you approach the content strategy to ensure it resonated with financial advisors and helped them achieve their business growth goals?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That's a great question. It was definitely something that we handled using, um, what what was happening at White Glove while I was there was we were leasing a a content platform, uh, that was widely used, um, and that we were paying a lot of money for, but that allowed advisers to share paywalled content, which was kind of the, uh, opportunity benefit that was being promoted to financial advisers and consequently to their clients, the type of people who, um, basically the incentive would be I'm gonna follow financial advisor x on Facebook because by doing so, I'll be able to read stuff on Forbes and Barron's, etcetera, uh, financial outlets that pay well their content. Bloomberg would be another example. Um, and we were getting away from that. We were we were having to do it ourselves. And so, um, so we we actually had an opportunity to spend 3 or 4 months surveying our current client base of financial advisors and asking them the type of content that they think would be good for their audience. Now we also recognize that they wouldn't necessarily be the best judges of that. Um, for example, uh, we got a lot of feedback about not including or even bothering to write anything about cryptocurrency. That's, you know, that's it was a type of thing that, um, that financial advisers were tired of hearing about, but at the same time, from a from a conversion standpoint in terms of bringing in new clients, it tested extremely highly after the fact for being the type of thing that that people were actually coming in the door and talking about. And that became particularly true as time went on and as we have now reached the point where there are Bitcoin ETFs and soon to be ether ETFs. This is the type of thing that, um, that at least the younger client base of financial advisers work with are definitely interested in diversifying their portfolio and especially given the state of the market right now, uh, in terms of being at an all time high. So, um, so to some degree, we were able to, uh, modulate and control the type of content that financial advisers would see and particularly the stuff that they wouldn't see, but it was also part of my job and our role as a company to convince them that the topics like LGBTQ would be another example that they might consider to be, um, outside of their purview and also potentially politically hazardous are also exactly the kind of things that a, get interest from people, and, b, may potentially grow a client base because, of course, with the younger generation, there are also more gay couples and things like that, and it's and it's financial advisers. Uh, once they use the platform would recognize that if they shared content about that, they could control who got to see it, um, and and and also who didn't get to see it so that they could be less conservative in their approach.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's fascinating to see how you navigated the balance between the financial advisors' preferences and the actual audience engagement data. Given the success of introducing topics like cryptocurrency and LGBTQ finance, how did you measure the impact of these new content areas on the financial advisors' client acquisition and retention?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That was just something that we would reach out, uh, after 6 months, uh, of being on the platform. Actually, we did a small survey at 3 months and then a bigger one at 6 months. And, uh, in addition to the daily feedback that we would be getting through private channels, things like emails and chat, etcetera, that we were, uh, that we were keeping in contact with financial advisers. But we also did a concerted survey to see how these people were feeling about their content. And then, um, and, of course, also ask them to rate the effectiveness of certain content. There were also it's was not a huge client base of financial advisors, so it was the type of people that our account team regularly interface with. And I would say it was a priority of mine to, um, to route as many of those calls over to me as possible and or to be interacting with, uh, the 2 women who were in charge of the account base to hear the anecdotes about how certain content was performing and others not. Um, you know, the the there was never it was never surprised that backdoor Roth conversions were of interest to people, but, uh, it was it was, um, heartening to hear that, uh, social issues were driving as much of the conversation.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you had a comprehensive approach to gathering feedback and measuring the impact of the content strategy.

We we I would say it's not easy to say how we did that. Uh, that's just what we did. I mean, we we would, um, we would continue to write about basic issues, but, um, I think we recognize that what is a Roth IRA was not the kind of thing that would get the same feedback as something that was a little more incendiary, especially given that we were using social media. So I would say, um, I actually think from the beginning, we bit off a lot of of, uh, news verticals and\n\n""], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you were able to identify and leverage the power of engaging and sometimes controversial topics to drive engagement and conversation.

You didn't get new ones all the time, so we were able to basically say, oh, this is our financial expert and they really get, uh, how we're writing, uh, how we're trying to write in a certain quasi journalistic tone, but but mostly on the informative side of things. And and then when we threw that person, um, a maybe more incendiary topic, and I don't think we ever did anything too incendiary, they knew to write it in our kind of brand voice because that was what that company in particular specialized in.

I can give you the example. We did the high demand hiring. So what we do that in Amazon, we have a hire tool. So, basically, in that hire tool, what happened that the candidate receives one link and that the automatic scheduling happens.

After that, uh, that, uh, if the slot matches, then the interview got fixed and that interview happened. If not matching, the slot, what, uh, that candidate comes to us and what we do that, like, we should do it manually.

So what we try to do is matching the slot as quickly as possible because the slots books very fast because there is not a one candidate. There is multiple candidates. So what we do that, we individually connect with that interviewer and ask them if you can upload it this slot or you can suggest us any slot in which you can available.

The community management is the play key role in the organization because whenever we, uh, engage the candidate with that, uh, we whenever we engage the employee in the community management, what happened is that they feel like, right, that, yeah, companies, uh, organization is doing something for us. Like, they are providing us party, and, uh, they are gathering to get together. And yeah. So what we do that? First of all, from my suggestions to retain the candidate, what we need to do that, we need to make a portal. In that portal, what we can do that, we can provide an open forum where the employees can put their problem feedback and all the details to us so we can move forward with that. And if there are any issues the prop employee situation, we can directly resolve that issue. Because, uh, what happened is that whenever the comp whenever the employee is leaving the organization, there must be some issue in that.

Not only top candidates, all the candidates necessary for our organization. So, yeah, if there are some issue, we can help we can solve that. And that community engagement, this is a major part. Like, uh, creating a forum from our company, it is a major part in the community engagement because where all the community members can engage and have their conversation, like providing feedback, providing any issues they are facing, providing any type of problem so that we can solve that as an HR of the company, we are the we are the only people to hear the candidate issues and solve them. Uh, as per because of the community engagement, what happened is that they're openly they can openly tell any issue, and we can make them anonymous also. Because make them anonymous, they can feel confident, and we are also getting them some type of problem which they are facing. And if there any specific issue at all the issues cannot be specific.

For the time saving and proficiency improving in our employees, so we need to I used to I'm with Power BI, and it is a form of Excel. And, uh, I used MS Excel as well. I used MS Word as well. In MS Excel, what we do that we you have to perform root cause analysis of that particular case. So in root cause analysis, we are able to find out all the things which happened and what and we performed the power, uh, RC in that.

Like, uh, someone messaged them in on their messaging platform, uh, the company messaging platform. So what happened is that there was some miss misinterpretation that, uh, that employee is taking more time, but that's not correct because someone is messaging them on the official company messaging portal. So we need to solve that issue also. Like, both issues are very important because we don't focus on that particular scheduling task. We have to, uh, we have other works also. So what we do that, uh, at that time, uh, there as there are some other works also at that same time, what we did that, uh, we, uh, introduced 1, uh, one extra column.

And, uh, we have doing that work, uh, from the previous times. So this, uh, increase the morale of the employee, and it helps the employee to work, um, more better. So, yeah, we do the needfuls for the every employee which they can perform. And, uh, yeah, I can say that we, uh, we recognize the employee's work, and they are also perform very well if they are, uh, like, from, uh, I can take me with an example. I was the one of the best employee of the month at the time of my joining. I when I joined after that 1 or 2 month, I got the Tesla award, and it creates a good with goodwill.

That is correct. Like, uh, what we do that we come sometime we did the night shift, and sometime we did the evening shifts. And what happen if that particular employee is not available? It may be. It may do not be not available. But what we do that, we drop an email, and, uh, we can come back and check later. And if, uh, is there any type of emergencies there, we can connect with them because sometime it's happened. We need to connect with that employee and which we need to check what's happening.

That, uh, sometime evening shift will work, sometime night shift will work, sometime morning shift will work.

And at the time of entry in Amazon, there was the requirement that you need to be learn English as much. And if you are good at read a language, that is also not an issue. Like, in the mostly, the cross region things happen sometimes in a month or in in a quarter. So, yeah, mostly what's happened in the local language so that local language will help them. And if there are any type of issue they are facing, like, uh, in speaking English and something like that, we have regular training sessions also, and we have the KT, the k net trainings, which we have, which, uh, which the HR team designs for them.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \n', 'Interviewee: You? Sure. Go ahead.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: Great to hear! Let's dive into your resume. I see you've had extensive experience with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), particularly Greenhouse, Lever, and Oracle. Can you elaborate on how you've leveraged these systems to improve the hiring process, specifically in terms of data-driven decision-making and enhancing diversity and inclusion?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. So, um, uh, last I worked in Greenhouse, and, um, there are a lot of reports we used to pull, like, source of hire and, um, um, time to hire, time to fill, um, then conversion ratio. So these things help in, um, gauging that, uh, in your whole interview process. They talk about time to hire, then um, which step took the maximum time and then do the root cause analysis and then understand what's the problem and solve it so that you can decrease the time to hire. Same for, um, the time to fill that, you know, which steps are were there where lot of rejection happens. Say for that matter, if the rejection is happening between, um, recruiter call, like screening and hiring manager phone screen, that means screening needs to, um, get better. And then they sit with the hiring manager, talk again about the requirement, talk to them about keywords, and maybe target companies and any, um, and every knowledge around it and then improve the screening part. If the rejections are happening between the hiring managers, um, screening and then the, uh, full loop interviews, Then, uh, the calibration is the issue. Then we just, um, you know, we, uh, request the hiring manager that he may he or she may sit with the hiring team and talk about it, that why there is this gap. So this was about data driven approach, um, by using ATS, um, like, using their reporting systems. And if I talk about diversity and inclusion, again, uh, through ATS, we can pull reports where it says about the pipeline health that is it diverse or not, um, gender diverse or not, or other kind of diversity is included or not. Then we can accordingly take measures. Like, one of the measure we took around was, uh, in our internal panel, um, it was not necessarily the gender diverse. So we made a mandate that, um, it has to be gender diverse. So whenever a hiring manager used to provide us the interview panel, they have to, you know, share, um, agenda diverse panel for sure. Thank you.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach to leveraging ATS for data-driven decision-making and diversity initiatives. When it comes to the reports you mentioned, such as source of hire and pipeline health, how do you ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data, especially considering the impact it has on strategic decision-making?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Oh, sure. That's a very important piece. Um, uh, I used to tell it to my team. It's like garbage in, garbage out. So if we are making decision based on the these data so these data output or on the insight comes from the input we give it to, uh, the machine. So the system doesn't have their own intelligences as of now if we talk about. So, um, I used to talk to my team that whenever we put any data, we have to be really accurate about it. Like, uh, for that matter, I'll give you an example. Like, sometimes what happens is, like, a hiring manager say that, okay. I'm keeping this, um, like, requirement on hold for some time. And if the TA person doesn't go and change that into the system, that, okay, it is on hold for now. The aging will keep on going. Right? So, um, that will reflect the wrong data about that rule that, okay, this rule is open for this long, while in actual, it was on hold. So, uh, to make sure that whatever data is going into the system is accurate and correct is important aspect of it. And that, um, goes without saying that each and every member of the TA team takes care of it and be very vigilant about it and be very active on it. Um, so that's how I took care of this piece.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Absolutely, the ""garbage in, garbage out"" principle is crucial in data management. Shifting focus a bit, you mentioned leading a global talent acquisition team with positions ranging from 90 to 300 open roles. Could you discuss a specific challenge you faced in managing such a large-scale operation and the strategies you implemented to address it, particularly from a stakeholder management perspective?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Sure. Um, stakeholder management piece is one important or strong point of me, I would say, in my role. Um, I give very, uh, important, uh, like, due weighted latest to communication. Communication is the key piece in stakeholder management. And, uh, what all it can do best. So right from the kickoff meeting, when you meet the hiring team for the first time, so you set, uh, everything at at place. Like, you know, you start with your, um, SLAs first that okay. These these these are my SLAs, and my recruiting team will take care of it. But at the same time, uh, recruiting is a partnership. Okay? So it's not that just the hiring. The recruiting team, uh, will do all part. We need equal support from the hiring team, the hiring managers, the interviewers. So, um, setting the stage up, setting expectations up, like, you know, following the industry standards of feedback sharing, like, within 24 hours, uh, the feedback should be in the system. And then, um, if if we have scheduled an interview and you're not able to make it, um, after accepting the invite, so it's your duty to, uh, give give your, you know, your replacement at that time so that we can take care of the candidate experience part. Apart from, you know, doing the kickoff meeting and, um, bringing everybody at, um, uh, at same, uh, ground, the expectation setting in SLAs. Um, then the approach which I take is a 3 stage approach. Like, first, I believe in listening very clearly with open ears and, um, understanding their pain areas, what exactly they want, what are the their main concern areas. Um, the second stage comes where, um, I share my research, my knowledge with them, and understanding of the candidate landscape and the candidate market, how it looks like, and share with the hiring manager and set up that trust that, yes, we know our bit, and, um, this is the insights. This is the, um, current, um, talent mapping, which um, we know and share with them. So the trust is where they know and they understand that, okay, we are coming with, uh, some background, some research, some knowledge. Then the 3rd stage come where, you know, we execute stuff and then we hear each other, like, if we are, um, not satisfying them. So we hear, um, our feedback constructively and try and improve on that side. Same way when you build that trust and, um, cater to that, then they also are ready to hear what you have to say. Like, you know, sometimes what happens is, like, they're looking for a star, a player and keep running towards that and, um, not understanding that maybe that skill mix is not not, um, that, um, abundance in the market. So, um, this is the piece which, uh, helps me in stakeholder management. Then 4th part comes is is is the data sharing. Like, you know, when you share the data with the hiring manager that, okay, we have reviewed these many profiles. Out of them, we'd screened out these many candidate, and then we just are sharing these, you know, fully filtered candidate to them. So making them aware of the process also that, um, what due diligence we are doing from our part, then they are more, um, you know, accepting and, um, understanding. So that also helps in stakeholder management. And, yeah, I guess this is all.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your three-stage approach to stakeholder engagement, starting with listening and moving to knowledge sharing and execution, is quite insightful. How do you ensure this level of engagement and process adherence across different teams, especially in a geographically dispersed setup like North America and APAC?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. Good question. Um, so when you set an approach and process, uh, it's always important that you do the consistency and, um, cater to everybody equally. And for that, um, I I I I believe in empowering my team. So it should not be that I'm the bottleneck, and I always do all bits and piece of it. So, um, as I said that I was managing the global team, um, sitting in North America and India, who was managing APAC. And North America, the team sitting in California, Campbell, was managing North America. So I used to empower my team, um, impart all the knowledge and all the approach with them, and keep them trained and, uh, mentored around it. And, um, I I created different swim lanes for different recruiters that, okay, this department, uh, you will be handled. So these are your stakeholders. And, um, so their level would be till director level. And if there, um, my, uh, if there is any escalation. So I, um, used to come into the picture. So I I I did this management incrementally, you can say, and keep on, um, believe in continuous improvement and continuous, um, empowering of the team and, uh, continuous um, mentoring of the team, um, where, uh, you set, um, KPIs for them very clearly that these are your KPIs. Stakeholder management is also a piece. Um, and, um, accordingly, they understand that it's not about just the execution that, okay, a hiring has come and then you have to just fill that with numbers. No. The quality matters, and, um, that will increase your stakeholder management. So so, um, keeping that, you know, regular in your team helps in managing it across the, um, across different reason, across different time zone. And I am one person which don't believe in, um, um, holding up anything. Like, if anything is pending on me, I'm the blocker. I would, um, do it right away. And I used to make myself available, uh, in different time zone as well. Like, you know, I used to be up in ISTRs as well even being in Vancouver, because I really like recruiting function, and I can't hold things up, um, just on me and, uh, keep the whole process hanging. So that helped me.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Empowering your team and establishing clear swim lanes for responsibility is a strong management approach. Shifting focus to the technical side, you mentioned implementing ATS systems, particularly Lever. What were some of the key technical challenges you faced during the implementation of Lever, and how did you overcome them to ensure a smooth transition for your team?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Nice questions. So, um, technical as in, um, as I'm into recruiting functions, it was not like, uh, any tech part I did for the implementation. So the tech implementation was done. I would say that what part I worked for was the acceptance of it. You know? Because change is one thing which is not welcome for, uh, welcome all the time. Okay? Like, especially for hiring managers and interviewers. So they're already busy with their core work. Right? Their core work was their function. And when you change thing, it is a overburden, overhead for them. Right? So, um, making them understand the value of it that, okay, right now we are spending some time on it, but, uh, in long run, it will save immense time of them. Right? Because everything doing over email and losing tracks of it and, um, that, uh, waste a lot of time for everybody. And having an ATS, um, so making them understand the value of it that everything will be at one place. In one click, you can see different things. It will give you different insights about your team, about, um, the work, about how many team members are taking, how many interviews. So you will have a good assessment of your contribution in hiring and your team members' contribution in hiring. So I would say the, again, uh, the management piece of, uh, uh, of acceptance of the new ATS, uh, which I worked. And then, uh, definitely, on technical side, I would say that, um, I created different forms like feedback form. So I created a, um, feedback form, um, in the system, and then I gave a presentation come training to the interviewing and hiring team to tell them, like, how it is working. Like, I used that, um, scale of 1 to 5 for ratings. So what means what? Like, one means least and 5 means more. So, um, sharing them about it and where they can, um, apart from rating, how where they can give the detailed feedback. So introducing them to the different fields and how to navigate, um, across the ATS, um, for the info they need. Um, so that part I took care of during the implementation.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Focusing on the change management aspect of the ATS implementation is crucial, especially in a field where technical adoption might face resistance. How do you envision leveraging more advanced technologies, such as AI and machine learning, within the recruitment process to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness, and what challenges do you anticipate in adopting these technologies in a talent acquisition context?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Wow. So, um, AI, ML, these things are future. Right? Every industry is is embracing it, and recruiting function has to embrace it if, uh, we want to be, um, you know, seen as a valued partner, um, with different functions. Right? So, um, I have seen different, um, tools like, uh, MetaView Notetaker, um, um, then this platform where I'm currently giving interviews. So that seems quite useful and, um, time saving. Um, so I definitely welcome these, uh, tools, these, uh, interventions and recruiting function, and I see that it will be only helpful. The challenge part is that, um, this function deals with human. Right? And we should not lose the human touch and, um, and that feel. So there always should be some personalization, but, um, using, um, AI and ML will be beneficial. The only trick point is striking a good balance that, you know, you can have best of both the world. That empathy, that human touch, um, and along with the technology, um, will make us grow in leaps and bounds. So, yeah, that's my view around it.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Finding the balance between technological efficiency and human touch is indeed a critical point, especially in a field as people-centric as recruitment. In terms of the tools and platforms you've mentioned, like Metaview and note-taker, how do you evaluate the effectiveness of these AI-driven solutions in terms of their impact on your key metrics, such as time to hire, quality of hire, and candidate experience?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So if I talk about Metaview notetaker, um, that's definitely a good, um, I would say, tool for both the part you you mentioned, like candidate experience and efficiency and quality. Because, see, uh, what meter view, uh, note taker does is they'll take notes, uh, of the interview and then send it to the interviewer. So many a time what happens that they hear from, um, the interviewers that, okay. I don't have time to give feedback, and I'll do it later. And then when they go on go back on, um, um, later and then they start writing feedback there, they have, you know, lost maybe critical part of the interview, uh, and then discussion. So having met of your notetaker, uh, in the picture, they'll have they can, you know, they can review the notes. They can refresh their memories by filling the feedback. That will increase the quality of hire. Right? Because when the correct feedback goes into the system, um, then the decision will be better. So that helps how, um, the note taking and efficiency, um, like, you know, uh, you do not to worry or bother about writing those notes, and the system is doing it for you. So you are a 100% into the conversation, and you are more involved. So, again, giving a good, um, candidate, uh, experience because, um, they will also feel that, yes, you are not just a machine taking notes, but you are actually involved in the conversation. Right? So it definitely help in efficiency, quality of hire, and then, uh, candidate experience because, um, candidate also feels, uh, much engaged, informed, and they have necessary tool, uh, for the interview.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: The use of Metaview Note Taker to enhance both the interview process and candidate experience is a strategic application of AI to achieve multiple goals simultaneously. As you look to integrate more of these AI-driven solutions, what criteria do you use to select which tools to adopt, and how do you ensure they align with your overarching recruitment strategy?  \n\n', 'Interviewee: Okay. Um, I would say the cost, uh, plays an important, um, role here that and and the scaling as well. Like, if you are, uh, so every company has different challenges and different, um, and they are at a different stage in that company life cycle. You know? So, um, it is, uh, quite dependent on, um, the company. So if your company is, um, at some scale, so you have to evaluate, um, ask for them that, you know, the cost involved, what return on investment ROI you are getting out of it. And you will have to measure that quality of hire, the efficiency, the, um, the, um, the candidate experience, um, to to cater for that. Like, okay, you can do, say, a test run and, um, meaning companies do provide demos and, um, uh, test subscriptions for these AI tools. So use that tool, evaluate your, um, matrix around it, and how it held it. Does it really change? And what percent does it change? The the the impact it is having, is it, um, you know, um, good enough to invest that amount? So that will be the approach, you know, cost versus ROI.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

So, uh, 2 Excel reports, I used to make the report where it was clearly mentioned that for the month, how much we have achieved our target, how much can how many candidates are offered, how many are still in the progress.

And due to the improvement of the candidate pipeline and due to the improvement of the candidate profile and and the candidates who are serious, who are active, who are responsive, Because of that, we, uh, were we were able to achieve our targets, and we were also able to, uh, you know, provide, uh, good candidates to our clients.\n'], [""Interviewer: Achieving such significant improvements in target fulfillment is commendable. It's clear that your feedback had a direct impact on the efficiency of the recruitment process. In terms of candidate quality, how did you ensure that the candidates with shorter notice periods or immediate availability still met the necessary skill and experience requirements for the positions, and what methods did you use to verify this before presenting them to the hiring managers?  \n"", ""Interviewee: So, uh, once we had the candidate pipeline of the candidates with less than, uh, one one month of notice period or who were immediate joiners, We used to do the proper screening. Sometimes we did online. Sometimes we did offline in the recruitment during the recruitment drive at our office at Infosys. So, uh, we were having this proper screening process where we made sure that all the highlighting, uh, you know, requirements of the jobs are met before we send those candidates for the in, uh, job interview. So once they, uh, pass their screening process and once we made sure that they had all the documents that were necessary, uh, for the process, then we, uh, schedule the interview with the with our managers, and they took the interviews. And after properly assessing their, uh, you know, uh, their skills. Only after that, they proceeded with the selection process. And after the background checks, document verification, we had this one on one call with them, offer negotiation with them, where we made sure that they were okay with the offer that we are providing from our company. So once everything was set, only then we proceeded with the onboarding and process offer release process. So that's how we made sure that the candidate has all the skills that are required for the job that he has to perform.\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach to screening and ensuring candidates meet the job requirements is thorough and essential for maintaining quality in the hiring process. Given your experience with both online and offline screening, can you share how you adapted your screening process to ensure consistency and fairness for candidates, regardless of whether they were screened online or in person at a recruitment drive?  \n', ""Interviewee: So, uh, because all the candidates that we had, you were receiving either from our, uh, direct sourcing team or through the Naukri profiles or through the vendors. So we were collecting the profiles from all the sources that were available to us and from all the sources that we could source from. And after that, we had this phone screening first where we used to screen all the candidates, uh, no matter what the source is from where the candidates, uh, we have selected from. So, uh, we used to do the phone screening first where we make sure the candidate is responding responsive. We had this response from the candidate. He's active. He's sending his documents, and, uh, he's available to join within the required time and everything after only after that, we did the proper screening face to face screening, it was. And we used to do that, uh, uh, online as well as offline. So most of the time after COVID, we used to start, uh, doing it offline only so that we have this conversation face to face with the candidates where we can properly, uh, you know, connect with them and properly understand their, uh, you know, their communication skills, their other skills that are required for the job. So, uh, yeah, we make sure that the screening is done. Before COVID, we make sure that it was done online and it is done properly on the phone as well as on a video call. And even if it was after COVID during the, uh, during our 2 pill drives at office or anything like that. We also made sure that we are the screening is going as, uh, same as we're doing it online. So there was no difference online or or offline because we are we were doing it face to face.\n""], [""Interviewer: Maintaining consistency in the screening process, whether it's conducted online or in person, is crucial for fair candidate evaluation. Given your experience with both methods, how do you ensure that the criteria for evaluating communication skills and other job-relevant competencies remain consistent across different modes of screening, such as phone, video, and in-person interviews?  \n"", 'Interviewee: So, uh, like, uh, at Infosys, I used to there was a process for all the, uh, you know, profiles that we were hiring for. Like, for finance, like, apart from c s, c s, we were only doing the phone screening and the video screening, offline screening after that in scheduling interviews and documentation, everything. But for finance, we also have the test. So for different, uh, profiles had different processes that were that involved that was involved. So we used to take the test first. Once the candidate passes the passes the test, only after that the screening was done. So at that point, only for the finance profiles, we make sure that, uh, the candidates already had the knowledge and skills that are required for the job. And after that, we used to, uh, communicate with the candidate to understand, uh, the skills of the candidates in person. And after that, we after the screening is done and they are shortlisted, I used to send them for the in, uh, interview schedule. So once the interview was done and once the candidate was selected, we went for the document verification and background check and offer negotiation and offer release. So that was the process. So the test which, uh, showed that all the skills and knowledge is already, uh, you know, the the candidate is capable of doing that. Capable the candidate has a capability of the skills. Candidate has all the knowledge that is required for that particular job.\n'], [""Interviewer: Implementing a test as part of the screening process for finance profiles is a solid strategy to ensure candidates have the necessary technical skills. When you're evaluating these tests, how do you standardize the scoring or assessment to ensure fairness across all candidates? Additionally, how do you handle situations where a candidate may perform exceptionally well on the test but doesn't demonstrate the same level of competence during the in-person or video interview?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah, sure. So during the test. There was a criteria that the candidates had to meet. Like it was something I think 60% was there which carried was you know supposed to pass. So once the candidate has cleared the test and it was same for everyone. So on the test basis a lot of candidates were selected for the you know, move forward for the screening process. And once we had the candidates who have cleared the tests mostly what happened the candidates were cleared the test working capable of you know, clearing the screening process also, but only few of them who are for voice profiles supposed that they're having this voice profile for years or something and even for finance they were some of the candidates some of the profiles which were voice process not for non-voice. So for voice process, it was in a very necessary for us that we checked the communication skill of the candidate. And for that abuse to do the screening and even if the candidate has the technical skill, but the communication is not well, he's not able to communicate his knowledge communicate his ideas Thoughts with the managers. So they were not selected up to that process because in that particular job, it was very necessary the candidate because candidate has to speak a lot communicate with people a lot and tell them regarding that process. So if the candidate is was not able to communicate. Well, we didn't, you know proceeded with the other processes and the candidate was not selected any further. Even if the candidate has a cleared the test. Yeah.\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

How did you approach the tone and style of the messaging for Peacefully, considering the sensitive nature of the services they provide?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. That was a that's a great question. And I, uh, what we did was we focused on being we looked around, first of all, competitors and saw how, uh, the other businesses that were in the same space spoke because, uh, one way that we recognize to stand out was have distinction in our brand voice. And we recognized that there was, uh, a lot of coldness in their tone. So we really worked on being as empathetic as possible, especially as you mentioned given the sensitive nature of the work. And so we looked at every communication on Instagram, etcetera, and made sure that it sounded like a human being, and that it also sounded like it was, um, even though we were providing necessary information, it was put in such a way that it was considered of where a person may be in their life in terms of potentially having just experienced a loss.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you put a lot of thought into that process. How did you measure the effectiveness of this new brand voice and messaging approach, particularly in terms of user engagement or feedback?  \n\n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. We primarily looked at reviews and actually we interfaced a lot with our, uh, with our client base because, essentially, we were pretty small and we and the first couple people who are using the platform were, um, were essentially the first. So we were able to communicate directly with them. Some of them we actually knew personally. And we got a lot of important feedback about how the flow of information and questions was designed. Uh, we and we we, uh, of course, we were cautious of the fact that the sample size was not huge and but we did insist that people were unsparing in their criticism and then we factored in their feedback. And as time went on and we got more and more feedback, we were then able to test the changes that we were making against, uh, how people were feeling about the content.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: That's a very hands-on and user-centric approach to feedback. Shifting focus a bit, I'd like to discuss your experience with SEO best practices. Can you describe a particularly challenging SEO problem you encountered at White Glove Financial and how you solved it?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Our goal at White Glove Financial was to write new content that would live inside of a platform and, uh, that we had built. And, uh, actually, we had acquired it. We had acquired it from another company, but then we were refining it for our needs. Uh, the company was, uh, the the goal of the company was for financial advisors to stay in touch with clients and recruit new business. And, uh, one of the ways to do that is basically to be introducing topics to people that were, um, that were sufficiently interesting and but would also lead to the conclusion that they could not master the subject themselves. They had to speak to a financial adviser. So what we did was we would have content that lived on our own platform, but we would share it on social media. And I would say the challenge with Facebook social media is, first of all, just from a back end standpoint, they are skeptical of platforms like ours, so we really had to be rigorous in conforming to their, um, their proprietary standards, um, because if you were too boring, uh, in your in any aspect of your content, it would not share that content widely, and it was really working against what we were trying to do for those financial advisors. So suffice to say that that that course that position required a crash course in Facebook SEO in particular, uh, now Meta, but we weren't really primarily using Instagram as much as we were trying to use Facebook because we recognized that that was more in line with where the customer base primarily was interacting on social media.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's interesting how you tailored the content to not only be engaging but also to drive a specific action. Given the challenges with Facebook's algorithm and standards, can you elaborate on some of the specific strategies or techniques you found most effective in ensuring your content was both engaging and compliant with their standards?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. I would say the way to do that within Facebook is that you're essentially just answering line by line as you probably know, um, both, uh, a subject title and then an article title. And so what you would do was, of course, you'd have the article title be something that would be outward facing and engaging. But then sort of the subject title would be, uh, basically a keyword rich thing that Facebook would recognize, um, as something that should be shared widely if someone was, uh, the type of person who was reading, for example, a lot of financial information on Facebook or even the Wall Street Journal, for example, we recognize. Those are the types of people who, um, were, you know, a big part of our demographic. Because the whole point of the financial advisor situation is that you are trying to get people to realize they don't know enough about a subject. And on that end, ultimately, um, while the content was while the goal of the content was this was definitely to be clear, It was also to emphasize the many pitfalls of trying to manage financial, uh, advice and, uh, management of one's portfolio by oneself. So the the goal was definitely not to be, um, muddy, but it was essentially to communicate the the the the crucial importance of getting these decisions right and how also how much of a relief it is when those decisions have been outsourced to someone who is ostensibly a professional because essentially, the financial advisor's pitch is that you don't, um, you know, you don't get get into a limousine with someone who's never driven before, and if you've never driven before yourself, you don't just get behind the wheel of a car and start driving. Um, and and ultimately that, um, while on a surface level, financial decisions are simple from the standpoint of just investing in index funds has has been the operative wisdom for 20 to 30 years. There are also so many decisions underneath, uh, retirement investing. For example, um, management of one's home and estate, education saving and spending, etcetera, um, and then the tax implications of all that that one should be thinking about. And and the goal was to emphasize how a holistic approach like that is so much more advantageous than just thinking, oh, I'm gonna buy um, whatever index fund at a regular price and blah blah blah, and that's all I need to do to be in a good situation financially.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to content framing and targeting is quite strategic. Shifting back to the technical side, could you explain how you approached the technical aspects of SEO, such as on-page optimization or site structure, to ensure the content you were creating for the financial advisors' platform was not only engaging but also highly discoverable by search engines?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Although I think I've kind of done that a few times, but I I guess basically, uh, when you're working, uh, in the back end in meta and you are it it in some part, this was a collaboration with with the, uh, people who had built the platform that we were then using at White Glove, which was, um, which, as I said, was proprietary, but would also allow financial advisors to not only share content via social media, but also keep track of their clients and prospects. It was basically one big dashboard. So, uh, but that the some of the decisions about how to optimize, uh, and get plugged in directly to Facebook and what they needed were being handled by the back end developing people who, uh, who were a separate team, and I was not necessarily a part of that team. They did ask me what what they would love to from me would and I was very simple in my response, which is just, hey. We need, um, we need stuff that looks professional, and we need stuff that looks like it's coming from the Wall Street Journal and other, uh, outlets that people trust because we just don't wanna look like, well, a very bad version of NerdWallet, for example. Um, so but but I will say that, uh, the most of the decisions for how to optimize, um, from a digital standpoint were, uh, were being handled by the back end development team because the goal was not to go viral on Facebook necessarily. The goal was to be much more, uh, personal and and informative and not really trying for fireworks, but really trying to simply just look professional and those that required, um, just building a system that talked to Facebook and answered all the questions and and looked like it was a professional outlet.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you had a strong focus on the user experience and the credibility of the content. Given your role in ensuring the content's professionalism and trustworthiness, how did you collaborate with the development team to maintain a balance between the visual and functional aspects of the platform, especially in terms of SEO considerations?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, the platform was I there's a little bit of a lack of overlap here because the SEO considerations were, um, you know, but they were basically internally handled. And then when it came but when it came to actually, uh, the design of the of the interface itself, um, that it was important that financial advisers would have an easy time navigating that because those were our direct clients. Uh, we weren't dealing with people who were trying to reach financial advisers. We were dealing with financial advisers and and those people can be quite conservative in in their approach. So I would say the the abundance of focus was placed on simply having an easy to use professional looking sort of Charles Schwabbe type interface that, uh, the type of people who were our direct clients, which as I mentioned, were very conservative, basically mid market and small market financial professionals who were just trying to grow their business from 5 to 7 to 9 to 13. Uh, they could be sharing content on Facebook that was not just, hey, I'm a financial advisor, come talk to me, but was professional looking, um, and also, um, and also content that they could trust and that and that emphasize the right content goals, which is let's just get people in the door and start having a conversation regardless of where they're at in life, and especially if they're at a turning point in life, like getting their first job, getting married, etcetera.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's interesting to see how the focus on user experience and trustworthiness extended to the platform's design and functionality. Given the conservative nature of the target audience, how did you approach the content strategy to ensure it resonated with financial advisors and helped them achieve their business growth goals?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That's a great question. It was definitely something that we handled using, um, what what was happening at White Glove while I was there was we were leasing a a content platform, uh, that was widely used, um, and that we were paying a lot of money for, but that allowed advisers to share paywalled content, which was kind of the, uh, opportunity benefit that was being promoted to financial advisers and consequently to their clients, the type of people who, um, basically the incentive would be I'm gonna follow financial advisor x on Facebook because by doing so, I'll be able to read stuff on Forbes and Barron's, etcetera, uh, financial outlets that pay well their content. Bloomberg would be another example. Um, and we were getting away from that. We were we were having to do it ourselves. And so, um, so we we actually had an opportunity to spend 3 or 4 months surveying our current client base of financial advisors and asking them the type of content that they think would be good for their audience. Now we also recognize that they wouldn't necessarily be the best judges of that. Um, for example, uh, we got a lot of feedback about not including or even bothering to write anything about cryptocurrency. That's, you know, that's it was a type of thing that, um, that financial advisers were tired of hearing about, but at the same time, from a from a conversion standpoint in terms of bringing in new clients, it tested extremely highly after the fact for being the type of thing that that people were actually coming in the door and talking about. And that became particularly true as time went on and as we have now reached the point where there are Bitcoin ETFs and soon to be ether ETFs. This is the type of thing that, um, that at least the younger client base of financial advisers work with are definitely interested in diversifying their portfolio and especially given the state of the market right now, uh, in terms of being at an all time high. So, um, so to some degree, we were able to, uh, modulate and control the type of content that financial advisers would see and particularly the stuff that they wouldn't see, but it was also part of my job and our role as a company to convince them that the topics like LGBTQ would be another example that they might consider to be, um, outside of their purview and also potentially politically hazardous are also exactly the kind of things that a, get interest from people, and, b, may potentially grow a client base because, of course, with the younger generation, there are also more gay couples and things like that, and it's and it's financial advisers. Uh, once they use the platform would recognize that if they shared content about that, they could control who got to see it, um, and and and also who didn't get to see it so that they could be less conservative in their approach.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's fascinating to see how you navigated the balance between the financial advisors' preferences and the actual audience engagement data. Given the success of introducing topics like cryptocurrency and LGBTQ finance, how did you measure the impact of these new content areas on the financial advisors' client acquisition and retention?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That was just something that we would reach out, uh, after 6 months, uh, of being on the platform. Actually, we did a small survey at 3 months and then a bigger one at 6 months. And, uh, in addition to the daily feedback that we would be getting through private channels, things like emails and chat, etcetera, that we were, uh, that we were keeping in contact with financial advisers. But we also did a concerted survey to see how these people were feeling about their content. And then, um, and, of course, also ask them to rate the effectiveness of certain content. There were also it's was not a huge client base of financial advisors, so it was the type of people that our account team regularly interface with. And I would say it was a priority of mine to, um, to route as many of those calls over to me as possible and or to be interacting with, uh, the 2 women who were in charge of the account base to hear the anecdotes about how certain content was performing and others not. Um, you know, the the there was never it was never surprised that backdoor Roth conversions were of interest to people, but, uh, it was it was, um, heartening to hear that, uh, social issues were driving as much of the conversation.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you had a comprehensive approach to gathering feedback and measuring the impact of the content strategy. Given the success of this approach, how did you use these insights to further refine the content strategy and potentially explore new areas of focus for the financial advisors' platform?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, I think you just answered the question. We we I would say it's not easy to say how we did that. Uh, that's just what we did. I mean, we we would, um, we would continue to write about basic issues, but, um, I think we recognize that what is a Roth IRA was not the kind of thing that would get the same feedback as something that was a little more incendiary, especially given that we were using social media. So I would say, um, I actually think from the beginning, we bit off a lot of of, uh, news verticals and\n\n""], ['Interviewer: It sounds like you were able to identify and leverage the power of engaging and sometimes controversial topics to drive engagement and conversation. Given this shift in strategy, how did you ensure that the content remained informative and valuable to the audience, even when discussing more incendiary topics?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, I wouldn't say we ever got 2 incendiary, but I would say that, uh, we we worked closely with a, uh, with a company that, um, uh, hired writers on someone's behalf when you were in charge of a team, and they turned out the the you were able to work with the same writer. You didn't get new ones all the time, so we were able to basically say, oh, this is our financial expert and they really get, uh, how we're writing, uh, how we're trying to write in a certain quasi journalistic tone, but but mostly on the informative side of things. And and then when we threw that person, um, a maybe more incendiary topic, and I don't think we ever did anything too incendiary, they knew to write it in our kind of brand voice because that was what that company in particular specialized in.

Also, you do a lot of research, and, whether that's reading or watching things, to become familiar with the the brand itself. And then also you create characters that feel like real people. Just because they're an orc doesn't mean that they don't have thoughts and feelings. And then you give them all a want, which is sort of the biggest thing in writing in characters. Is, giving them something to sort of go after and then an obstacle in front of them.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Given the importance of maintaining a character's depth and motivation, how do you approach the writing process to ensure that these wants and obstacles are not only clear to the audience but also evolve over the course of a series?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, that is where planning comes in. That's where, it's called, you sort of think that the outline is for an individual script, but you also sort of build what you call the arc of the series. And in that, it's sort of you look at the series as a whole and kind of plot out your character wands over the course of the series. And then when you're working on individual episodes, you make sure that you address that so you're sort of moving the character across the, game board. For lack of a better term, to get to the end result at the end of the season.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you have a strong grasp of both character development and series planning. Shifting focus a bit, could you discuss a specific challenge you faced while working on the World of Warcraft animated series and how you overcame it, particularly in terms of maintaining the brand's integrity while still introducing new elements?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Oh, sure. So when you're working with a brand that's established, it can be difficult because, again, they have sort of these, deep roots, that have, been out there, and your audience In a lot of shows, you don't have to worry about what the audience will think because you're telling them who these characters are. But with something with an established brand, they already know who these characters are. And then you also have this, vast canon, of established rules, of established history, and so that can be really difficult, to address. And so for me, I broke down all of these issues into smaller pieces. So I didn't feel like I had to tackle everything as a whole. I always had sort of smaller, goals and aims that I would hit for each character. And then I would also reach out to, people who worked there to make sure that I was still sort of aligning with, the brand voice. And the longer that I worked on it, the easier it was where I knew I was hitting the brand voice. Because now I had had, my own experience working there and working within the company.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to breaking down the challenges into manageable pieces and leveraging internal expertise is insightful. Now, let's delve into the technical skills you've listed on your application, specifically screenwriting. Can you discuss a unique aspect of your screenwriting style that you believe sets your work apart?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Oh, sure. I think that, for me, screenwriting is a, very intuitive thing. I think of it as sort of I always refer to it as the beating heart. Plot is important, but your characters and who they are. People don't relate to plot They relate to people. And so all of my work is very care forward. Even if you can't relate to what's happening, you can always to who's on the screen. And even if that character is an orc or a squirrel, or, you know, a 72 year old alien or the sun. There's always something in it that's relatable and So\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given your focus on character-driven narratives, how do you approach the initial stages of a new script to ensure that the characters are not only relatable but also capable of carrying the story forward in a compelling way?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: that always goes back to the idea of outlining, making sure that your characters are sort of, pushing things forward. And for that, you really want active characters. You want characters who are not reacting to things, but are taking charge and making choices. And the reality is you also need to make sure sometimes those choices are incorrect because that's what makes it interesting and that's what makes it compelling is having those characters mess up a lot. That's also what makes it relatable. So, yes. So having those, like, active characters making choices, propels everything forward. To the end result.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that your approach to character development and narrative drive is quite deliberate. Shifting focus to another skill you've listed, content development, how do you typically approach the process of developing content for a new project, and what role does audience analysis play in this process?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: For content development, it's sort of thinking of, like, what is the the aim of the project. Are you trying to sell a story? Are you trying to sell a product? Are you trying to evoke a feeling? There's a lot of different, aims for content when you're producing that online. And, so that's sort of how I approach that. I forget what the second part of the of the question was.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: The second part was about the role of audience analysis in your content development process. How do you ensure that the content you're developing resonates with the intended audience, and do you have any specific strategies for gathering and incorporating audience feedback during the development phase?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, it's really tough. Generally, you don't have audience feedback during the development phase because you can sort of it's death by a 1000 paper cuts. Because not everybody is going to like everything. You can't have focus groups, but, it the really the key is sort of knowing your audience beforehand. And, making sure this is where things like theme and character play a great role. If you're writing for kids, making sure that like, the issues that are facing your characters are relatable to kids. The reality is your audience is going to have some some sort of through time with some some different outlooks in the sense of the technology will change and the language will change, but the feelings don't change. And so if you make sure to sort of adhere to those themes and your characters having these relatable moments, your audience will come along.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Given the challenges of incorporating audience feedback during development, how do you personally validate whether the content you've developed is resonating with the intended audience, especially for a project with a significant lead time before release?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Again, it goes back to this idea of of themes. There are sort of only so many themes out there. And, you know, a kid feeling left out or, you know, a bad breakup, it doesn't matter if you're in the year 2048 or you're in 1790 2. The feelings of those are always going to resonate with your audience. The other thing is, you know, sometimes there are new challenges that audiences face. And so a lot of that is research. A lot of that is going online, going to where your audience will be hanging out, whether that's looking at Reddit or looking at TikTok or you know, finding these sort of niche niche places, and sort of listening to how they talk, listening or watching, sort of what they watch, know, your audience may have, like, specific, shows that they enjoy. So, like, watch those shows and try to figure out, like, oh, what is it that they're relating to this? And I think what a lot of places get wrong is they get hung up on the stuff versus the feeling because the audience wants to feel something. That's why they always come back.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your focus on the universality of themes and the importance of understanding how and where your audience engages is insightful. Shifting back to your screenwriting skill, could you discuss a specific technique or tool you use to ensure that the pacing of your scripts is engaging and effective, especially in terms of balancing character development with plot progression?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Oh, sure. I think that a lot of that comes in the in the outline process, which is part of screenwriting even though it's not, like, technically sitting down and writing your screenplay. And, one of the things that I do personally is, once I'm sort of done crafting my outline is that I read it out loud. And reading it out loud, you can sort of tell where the lows hit. And when you're reading something, it's forcing you to engage with it. And so if you find that you're getting bored with it, then it's you know that it's boring and it needs more or the pace needs to pick up or there's there's a there's a point missing. So that's a technique that is super useful in making sure that, your pace, and timing and action is working But, honestly, over sort of the the course of my career, I've been doing this long enough where I can just I just know because it's my experience.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Reading the outline aloud is a great practical tip for assessing pacing. Given your experience, how do you handle situations where there's a difference of opinion on the pacing or structure of a script, particularly in a collaborative environment, and what strategies do you use to resolve such conflicts while maintaining the integrity of your vision for the project?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, it depends who's in charge. Usually, on every project, especially in television, there is one person in the writer's room who it's their vision. So if I am working for them, I may push my idea but I also will respect, I'll respect the boss unless I think it is something that is, actively harmful, and then I will stand my ground. If I am the boss, I will listen to feedback. I will even well, sometimes, it's called sort of pitching out. We'll pitch it out to sort of see where it ends up. And see, like, oh, maybe that is actually a a a better choice, but we need to sort of follow the story down the road a little bit. If the entire writer's room is agreeing, but, the brand or the, network is disagreeing, Sometimes, you know, we'll stand our ground. Sometimes, we'll we'll compromise. I usually I try to make everyone feel heard, because I think that's important. And, obviously, if they're bringing something up, there's a reason for it. But if I am the person in charge, I am also interested in always the best idea because if it's my name on it, then I get credit for it. But, but sometimes sort of the the I'll I'll let them pitch it out and follow their ideas down the road. And, generally, we can see then whether it's the better idea or not. So, again, willing to compromise because I'm only one brain, but also my level, of experience and knowledge is usually greater than lot of other people.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to handling differences in a collaborative environment is very diplomatic and strategic. Now, let's dive into a more technical aspect of screenwriting. Could you explain how you use the three-act structure in your screenplays, and do you have any specific techniques for ensuring that each act serves its purpose effectively?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Outline. Outline. Outline. You'll you'll know in the outline. That's why some people just will start writing, but your outline will tell you exactly, like, where you need to go. That's your road map. That's your skeleton, that you hang, your your tree your Christmas tree that you hang all of the ornaments on. So that that will sort of give you everything that you need to to go and do. Also, sometimes, breaking each act out and just, like, looking at one act at a time, can also, like, oh, is this enjoyable? Does this feel whole? Does this feel like there is a, a cliffhanger? There are certain screenwriting, tools. Some people use something called save the cat. I don't like to totally use it, but there are places where I think it's super useful, especially, when you talk about that, you know, act 2 dark knight at the soul, making sure that you kind of, hit those marks. Because what happens is that people sometimes, they just don't have anything kind of happen, and then it all happens at the end. And you wanna make sure that your your, your action is sort of plotted out, but that it still slowly grows over time. And that is, again, like, partially outlined and then, you know, looking at those active breaks to make sure that, it's getting to where you need to go. Also, I find that if you are having a problem with act 3, that means that you have a problem with act 1 because act 1 is sort of asking a question and act 3 should answer it. So if you can't answer it, chances are you probably weren't asking the correct question in act 1.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your emphasis on the importance of outlining and using the three-act structure as a guide is a solid approach. Given the complexity of the projects you've worked on, how do you manage the interplay between the overarching series plot and the individual episode plots to ensure a satisfying balance of closure and continuity for the audience?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That's a combo pack of you want to do something called it's called breaking the season. Which is essentially, I actually personally apply the 3 action structure of the outline to an entire season of episodes. So if I have a a 13 episode order, the first 3 episodes will be act 1, the last 3 will be act 2, and the 7 in the middle will be I'm sorry. The first 3 will be act 1. The last 3 will be act 3, and the 7 in the middle will be act 2. And then I sort of plot all of my, my characters need to be up here? Do they need to be down here? And then I sort of individually assign out kind of the plot, and the character wants and needs and obstacles in each episode. And then we individually outline those episodes. If I am working alone like I did on novel more, that's easier because it's all in my head and I've done it all. If I'm working with a writing staff then it's I sit down with the writers. I talk about sort of the issue. We may work on the outline together or I may give them the outline. And then, when they bring it back, I'll give appropriate notes And then there's probably a certain point where I will just go in and, do a do a quick polish ideally just to make sure that it's it's where it needs to be. And because I'm the boss, that's usually a pretty quick process. Again, because I've been doing it for a long time, and I'm the one ultimately responsible for the entire voice of the show.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach to structuring a season as a three-act narrative is a unique and effective way to maintain a cohesive story arc. Given the dynamic nature of the entertainment industry, how do you stay updated with the latest trends and audience preferences to ensure that your content remains relevant and engaging?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Oh, that's a good one. I don't I mean, I do. The problem is that whatever the audience is watching currently, it's gonna change in a year to 2 years. But whatever I'm working on now won't come out for a year to 2 years. So trying to chase what the audience is currently doing is not helpful. You do wanna sort of be forward thinking, this is where it helps to really know who your audience is Are you writing for kids? Are you writing for bridge? Are you writing for tweens? And then looking at kind of the emotional issues that your audience faces, and then writing towards that. Because the thing is once you're project, once your series is ready to be pitched, or once your screenplay is done, you can kinda go back and put in the kind of, things that will make it more current. But, you can't chase and what the audience is looking for right this very minute. Because, again, by the time your stuff comes out, it'll feel old. Because it will be 2 years out of date because that's, you know, the minimum it takes. To, get something from idea or script stage to out there. The audience to see.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your perspective on staying true to the core emotional issues that resonate with your target audience, rather than chasing current trends, is a valuable insight. Now, let's shift our focus back to your screenwriting skill. Could you discuss a specific technique or tool you use to ensure that the dialogue in your scripts is both natural and serves the story effectively?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. I've listened to a lot of people talk. That's super useful. Everywhere I go, I'm doing research And, you can sometimes you know, if you're worried about slang, just being online and sort of, like, against seeing where your target audience is hanging out and then, like, listening to them, or seeing what their talking about. But, again, that sort of falls out of favor pretty quickly, so I don't like to rely on that. The other thing to make dialogues sound natural is you read it out loud. And reading your, your screenplay out loud, even if you're doing all the parts, or sometimes you can, like, host a what's called a table read and have your your friends read it, really gives you the sense of what it sounds like, and does it sound like people talk. Or those characters, how they talk?\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \n', 'Interviewee: Yes.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've led a significant project at Harver, transitioning from a monolithic system to an event-driven architecture. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges you faced during this transition and how you addressed them with the technologies you mentioned?  \n\n"", 'Interviewee: So some challenges were maintaining, uh, consistent behavior across uh, this transition period from the legacy software to the new software. Uh, this was done through identifying what is, like, the list of APIs we have, their current set of behavior, uh, what is the expected behavior of all those APIs. This way as we as I led the transition, uh, from the legacy software to the event driven sort of more, uh, new serverless architecture. We maintain consistent behavior and thus induce the element of least surprise, which in this case would be to not suddenly change the behavior of any of these APIs, uh, throughout this transition period. And this was done using AWS Lambdas, s q AWS SQS. Uh, this is all on Python. And some of the, uh, legacy, uh, tools and technologies that were made use of consists of as Celery and, uh, RabbitMQ.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: That's a thoughtful approach to maintaining consistency during such a critical transition. Could you detail how you ensured the reliability and scalability of the new event-driven system, particularly in terms of managing the interactions between different services, and what role did Redis play in this architecture?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: This was through so the ecosystem behavior was maintained through rigorous test coverage. And so, uh, use it's made the use of tools like SonarQube and Codecov to measure the test coverage of our application code both before and throughout this development process, maintaining a high test coverage of, say, 98% and above. This helped to ensure that if any changes made, broke behavior, uh, those will be caught by tests and to help cover interactions across services because, uh, our services were made comprised of many different link services. And so interactions between and across services was very important to cover, and this was covered through the usage of integration tests, uh, something I introduced when I introduced the CICD pipeline using tools like Go CD. Uh, this helped to automate this whole process of testing our services and these various transactions, uh, in an automatic fashion and thus automatically be able to catch if any of these, uh, behaviors were broken or changed. And as for the usage, of Redis, Redis was used as a caching, uh, solution, uh, for one of the services that, uh, was being upgraded.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your emphasis on rigorous testing and the use of tools like SonarQube and GoCD for automation is impressive. Given your experience with maintaining high test coverage, how do you approach testing asynchronous processes, such as those handled by Celery in your Python applications?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: So you go about testing the individual application code that gets executed, uh, asynchronously. This helps to ensure that that piece of code is what's working. And then as for testing, okay, the actual application code that calls this asynchronously, uh, that is mocked in unit test coverage. And so there's coverage up to the point it gets executed, and then there's validation done to ensure that what's being asynchronously handed off is what's expected to be handed off. But then as for, like, testing the actual execution of the asynchronous code, that's where sort of these integration tests or these more, uh, expensive tests come into play. Uh, and that's where, like, the benefits of having a CICD pipeline to, uh, be able to introduce these kinds of tests, uh, becomes more valuable. So that way we can more thoroughly test our systems and thoroughly test not just, uh, transactions across services, but these asynchronous transactions as well and validate that they're behaving as expected.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you have a strong grasp on testing methodologies for both synchronous and asynchronous processes. Shifting focus a bit, could you explain how you approached the integration with Oracle and Workday, particularly in terms of handling data consistency and reliability across these disparate systems within your event-driven architecture?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. So it starts off with first working with external stakeholders, working with them on what are their APIs, what is their API contracts, working with clients, uh, understanding the client's needs, their expectations, what are the different user stories, uh, ironing out what are the different user stories and, uh, expected user experiences with the product. And then once we have all those pieces together, then we can go ahead and start building out and designing a system that integrates with these various systems, like Workday and Oracle, and supports these different, uh, user stories. And as for, like, data consistency and data reliability, uh, that's where, uh, making use of tools like, uh, so in this case, the servers that handle these integrations with these systems like Workday and Oracle. I made use of AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and our automatic retry policies played a big part in helping to ensure that if errors were occurring or something was just down temporarily, retries would automatically occur to help ensure those transactions continued. But then if those transactions failed altogether, uh, what I had in place was some rigorous logging and telemetry instrumentation setup via New Relic. And this helped to be able to quickly identify issues in the system and thus resolve them. And then on a per system or per client basis, uh, for if errors had occurred with the, uh, resolution strategy or contingency plan or fallback, uh, for those clients. Uh, depends on each of those clients and their needs. Uh, in some cases, we had mechanisms in place, uh, that not even engineering need to get involved with. But, uh, our client success team can they themselves, uh, empower them to be able to take into their own hands, to be able to initiate these processes to, uh, essentially\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to handling integrations and ensuring fault tolerance is comprehensive.

So I have joined in Contentstack as a senior software engineer. And, uh, so we already have an application which is running in the production from long back, uh, but that is a legacy application. It is a single code base. The code base is very huge. It contains, uh, more than 10,000, uh, commits and the repo size also very big. So what we planned, uh, is, like, to convert application into microservices. Give you an example, like, uh, the I have worked on, um, uh, 4, 5 components, which I converted to microservices. I I'll give you an example where, uh, we have converted that into microservices architecture. Uh, we have a functionality called Webex. So Webex is a functionality where if, uh, we will trigger the events to the customer's endpoints.

Since, like, we have a Alexa application, like, uh, if there is any issue in, uh, any of the component, we need to redeploy complete code base, and it's very difficult to maintain. So we had to convert that to microservice. So we created a new microservices application. Uh, so the application we have built it, uh, Node JS. Uh, we use it in SDS framework to build a microservice. Uh, Alan said we also have our sidecar, which will be used to authenticate and authorize the requests to the core CMA database.

So at the time, we cannot process all the webhooks. So we will, uh, use the SQS queues to process all these events. So for each event, we'll store in the queue, and the the microservices will pull that message, and then it will process it 1 by 1.

Uh, for rest API, we use the next framework, uh, where we have defined the each routes and, uh, which is exposed to the public. When it comes to the, uh, internal, uh, data internal data transfer, like, from 1 micro service to enter micro services, the gRPC is the good option since it is faster than the rest API service. So since, uh, that's why we have used the gRPC for the internal communication where uh, the other restricted methods are excluded through gRPC, which is, uh, easy and, uh, faster communication with the within the local metro services. Also, there is some digital consumers elsewhere, uh, we have used the SQS to pull the messages and to process those messages.

Yeah. Let's take the previous example which I told you, like, uh, Webhooks, microservices. There we have faced this issue where we are processing the events at 1 one event at a time. Uh, so how it is working is, like, each part level, one event will be processed once. So what happens is, like, if, let's say, one request is we will trigger a webhook to the customer's, uh, HTTP URL. And if the customer is taking longer times, automatically, it will completely affecting the performance of the application. Like, uh, if the each request is taking 20, 15 seconds, then it is a huge effect on the service. So what we thought is, like, we have implemented a feature, uh, in the Facebook microservices where we will concurrently process certain number of messages. In our case, it is 20. So each time it will tries to process 20 messages, we we will make, uh, we will, uh, handle a queue where, uh, each time there is, uh, 20 messages are there.

I'm ready.\n""], [""Interviewer: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you tell me a bit about your most recent role and how it has prepared you for the position of Product Manager? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Most recently, uh, I'm a product lead, uh, at a stealth mode startup where I'm making a marketplace, uh, for Indian transporters transport SMBs. So one interest some of the interesting aspects about of it are I did not use any marketing budget, so there was no performance marketing involved. There was there were no paid ads. All the growth has been purely organic and through growth hacks. Uh, so there was some, uh, growth loops which I had embedded into product, which included organic communities. So I was reading organic communities, uh, through AI agent and then converting those, uh, things onto my application, uh, so that my transport marketplace was automatically populated with organic genuine post. Uh, that's how I bootstrapped it and and generated a significant traction in short span without spending any, uh, you know, marketing thing. So the that that that that's about my my recent rule. I used, like, AI agent, open APIs. I I designed a very significantly better interface than than what what the existing computers are in the market are doing. And then one innovation was, like, reading organic communities through a WhatsApp bot and then, uh, converting those push into an organic push on onto the application. So these three were the, like, key elements of it. Um, I mean, that that that's an\n""], [""Interviewer: That's quite impressive, leveraging organic growth and AI to drive user engagement without a marketing budget. Given your experience with AI agents and APIs, how did you ensure that the data being scraped and used in your marketplace was reliable and respected user privacy, especially considering the sensitivity around transportation logistics? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Correct. So few things were there. Although I was using AI agent to populate my marketplace, uh, there was still a manual intervention just to make sure that, uh, like, all the data which is going into the my system is accurate. Uh, another thing, I had written some more APIs on top of it in order to validate whatever information I'm putting it. It's not considering like, having any sensitive information, any user specific information, which is automatically lead to our, uh, UI. So I had, like, multiple APIs on top of another or to validate those things. Um, in addition, I had, like, a person dedicated just to keep a watch over, uh, the organic post generated on the platform. If there is any mishap, like, you can immediately delete it, uh, with with the manual control. So these two things. Like, there were, like, couple of more AI kind of agent APIs which which, uh, made sure that every post is validated strongly against our set of criteria. And then on top of it, there was a manual, uh, checking as well. Uh, Yeah. These two things were were ensure, uh, like, ensured. And another thing was, uh, on our marketplace itself, we were making sure that the user personal information, which which are their phone numbers or any any name, that sort of thing, that is hidden from, uh, from the the the other marketplace users on the application until they submit their own information. So the way we ensure this, like like, uh, as I talk talked about, there was another top of APIs chained to to each other, uh, which ensured that, like, phone numbers is omitted, any personal data is omitted. And for the for that thing also, I use another like like, same open API, like, with another one. Like, ensure that there's no person data or everything, uh, is stripped off and masked from actually displaying on there and the and the end user of of this thing, marketplace postings. So, yep, uh, that that's how I dealt about it.\n""], [""Interviewer: It sounds like you've implemented a robust system combining automated checks with manual oversight to maintain data integrity and privacy. Shifting focus to your design skills, you mentioned creating a significantly better interface. Can you walk me through your design process using Figma, and how you ensured that the user experience was aligned with the needs of your transporters and SMBs? \n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so the thing is, uh, right now, I mean, if you want, I can show you, uh, the, um, like, my Figma sketches, but, uh, I'm not sure, like, I would be able to access those files right at the moment, but then I'll explain you the thought process. The thought process was, uh, ensuring what Indian transport SMEs typically prefer. They prefer WhatsApp US. They prefer coming their communication happening with mobile phone over any other apps. So I made sure that our app UI is very coherent with what what WhatsApp UI is and what call logs are. So they kind of feel this app is natural extension to what they have already been using. They they use typically phone calls and, like, in the personal connections. Uh, so one key, uh, feature was, uh, like, instead of having multiple, you know, multiple sections of that which they have to learn and explore, Uh, we kind of did a a call log kind of test in which, uh, the whole UI appeared as if, like, it was a series of call log interactions with other users. So there was post, there was track, there was, you know, call call made, call received. That type of interaction on a unified interface, uh, makes it very interesting for somehow, like, for the, uh, Indian consumers, uh, the transport SMBs. They don't like uh, want to learn different subsections and subsections of, uh, like like, you have typically, what a competitor would do is, uh, like like, what what other competitive apps are doing is they are they're having like, there is a top marketplace. There is a loan marketplace. Uh, then there is my load section, my truck section. Like, 4, 5 sections, it it's placed into it. But, no, but what why users are preferring online communities? Because it feels like a live interaction. Uh, like, one thing after another, not not necessarily categorized into different things. So that's that that's how we leverage our UI insights.\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to UI design is very user-centric, focusing on familiarity and ease of use by mirroring popular communication apps like WhatsApp. Given that you've tailored the experience for Indian transport SMBs, how did you incorporate feedback loops into your product development process to ensure that the features you were building were actually meeting the needs of your users? And how did you prioritize which features to develop next? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yep. So the thing is, uh, we had periodic feedback loops even before the product was launched. Uh, what what I would do is, like, prototype a thing in Figma and then actually take it to the local transporters and see like, without mentioning it to them that this is just a prototype and not an actual application, just see how they try to interact with that that screen. And, actually, record a screen, uh, you know, tabs and, uh, like, the way they're where they click and what their facial expressions are. I used to, like, notice it and then later studied, like, think thinking where did they feel actually confused or where did they were they were, like, encouraged to click on certain things. Um, that's how that's how I ensured, like, the the feedback loop loop was, uh, involved. Uh, I'm sorry. What was your what was your second question? I think you asked 2 questions. 1 was the feedback loop. How how did I incur incorporate? And what was the second question?\n""], ['Interviewer: No problem at all. The second part of my question was about how you prioritized which features to develop next based on the feedback you received and the data you collected. Could you elaborate on your process for feature prioritization in the context of your product management? \n', 'Interviewee: Could you elaborate on your process for feature prioritization in the context of your product management? Yep. Yep. So\n'], ['Interviewer: I understand that you agree with the user-centric approach, but could you elaborate on how you collected and integrated user feedback into your product development cycle? Additionally, what criteria did you use to decide which features to prioritize for development? \n', ""Interviewee: Yep. Correct. So one one is the traditional way of looking at it. Like, there is a a rise model evaluating, uh, which features are, like, the first to take. And, uh, I think that typically takes, uh, few things into consideration. How much is the effort involved? Uh, how much is the possible impact? Like, scoring some arbitrary numbers to it and checking the ratio of impact divided by effort, uh, and and then multiplying it with the possible reach of a particular solution. So that's how we would rank the the features, which feature to dial up first. And another thing is particularly one thing I personally try to use is, uh, uh, I have to check whether the value proposition of a particular solution or feature is significantly higher because this was a new product. So the value proposition had to be significantly higher than, uh, what the competing products are are available in the market. So it can't just be a better UI. So, uh, that that that that these are the 2 metrics, uh, or two parameters based on which I decided which features to build first. 1 was the first one was the value proposition, and second one was traditional ranking. How would you rank, uh, which which features are, like, uh, should be developed first? And then, uh, I mean, uh, for value proposition, I might go into little bit more elaborate. Like, you need to have, like, 2, 3, 4 times more better value proposition than than the existing competitive, uh, products. And then that's when users switch from current behavior to a new behavior. Uh, I think this is, uh, this is kind of, like, a little bit known theory of delta for value proposition. If there is a delta for value proposition in your product, then people like like, the the new behavior is 4 times better than the previous behavior, then then people are, like, naturally inclined to switch to the new behavior and not switch back to whatever the old behavior is. So these these two things. Yep. Rise model and value proposition.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a very strategic approach, utilizing the RICE model for effort versus impact analysis and the Delta 4 theory to ensure that your product stands out in the market. Given your technical background, how did you communicate these technical and product decisions to your development team, and how did you ensure that the technical aspects were aligned with the product vision and user needs? \n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. So few things we ensured, like, one one was, like, we ensured which part of the UI needs pixel perfection, which parts are, like, okay to, you know, change a little bit. For example, let's say on if you want to copy WhatsApp UI, it's good enough to copy the text messaging part and and, you you know, usual, uh, the color the color and theme, but don't have to go as detailed as, like, you know, making sure that the doodles used on WhatsApp are the same what what we are using on our app. So, uh, that's how I would communicate the user details, uh, to the design team that to ensure that, like, you have to make sure that which parts are, like, must have and which parts are, like, okay to kind of go a little bit vague about. As far as the technical team, I being, uh, being from an engineering background, I would I would make a detailed specification about which programs are to be done, which APIs are to be done, what input data is expected, what output data is expected. Uh, that kind of, like, API level specification and what automations are need to be done, uh, these kind of things which we, uh, which I give information to the tech team. And I also help on, like, which tool to pick. Let's say, uh, if you're, uh, doing browser Chrome automation, like, how to use JavaScript tool and selenium tool, you know, combine that automation and, like, which which libraries are best utilized and, uh, to open API, uh, availability and all those things. I made sure that the tech team does not have to think about, uh, which frameworks to use or even, uh, what what are the API specification. They just had to focus on what what was the core task given to them. And I I made sure that they they they get all the technical details.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that you have a strong grasp on both the design and technical aspects of product development, and you're able to effectively bridge the gap between the two. Considering your experience with web scraping and automation, how did you handle challenges related to data consistency and the potential for web scraping to break due to changes in the target websites? How did you ensure the resilience of your data collection methods? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yep. So, uh, being a new product and a new process, uh, we were not, like, very, uh, strict initially about, uh, what the consistency, let's say, data collection process, what if the the UI, uh, code itself on the website changes. So that particular part, let's say, if UI of, uh, like, the the HTML code are are changing on the the on on the WhatsApp side, like, the data collection may not be accurate. That part was honestly manual. Like, if there was a like, if program broke, then we we saw saw into the program and then then and then and then fixed that. And another another thing about, like, the consistency and everything, I as I already told before that uh, we had, like, couple of more edge AI agents to validate every post which were which were reading into our system. So these 2, uh, if, uh, the the about the web acceptance that, uh, code on the in on on on the website being chain and then that is impacting our data collection, we had checks in places to make sure that if such thing happens, we have to manually intervene and check which code or which usually, the the the these changes are really minor. Like, usually, some HTML tags, uh, do get changed on on the client website. Um, so those changes we will do manually, uh, check again what what what's the new updated code code and then just do it. As far as the exact content which we are reading, we had validation and already in place to ensure that those are relevant to our marketplace.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's good to hear that you had a validation process in place to maintain data quality. Given the manual aspect of handling changes in web scraping targets, did you implement any alerting mechanisms to detect when a scrape failed or when data quality issues arose? How did you manage to keep the downtime to a minimum in such scenarios? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Yes. So, uh, like, this was little bit hacky in a way that, uh, whenever the program kind of failed to read, uh, any organic post, uh, after multiple iterations, uh, and then failed to read. I don't mean to say, like, there was no organic push at all. The program broke in a sense that the element which you're searching for is not found, let's say. That's when you know that certain thing has been broken on our server. At that time, I'm I made a alert on on our Telegram, which would, uh, which would like like, it would send me a Telegram message that, uh, hey, Pawan, uh, something has broken because we're not able to read a particular element on this website, uh, HTML. That's how, uh, that's how we'll do. Uh, I I I would want to ensure that this was her part of the plan, but I did not actually end up implementing in the product because of the, you know, uh, constraints of time. But this was originally, uh, one of my plan or PRDs to ensure that we have a very high uptime, ensuring that sometimes whenever whenever there is a change in the client side and we are not able to find the element itself to read the data form, uh, we would get our Telegram alert. So I had a PRD prepared for it, but, technically, we do not end up implementing.\n""], [""Interviewer: I see, so you had a proactive approach in mind with the telegram alerts for monitoring the web scraping process. Even though it wasn't implemented, it's a sound strategy for minimizing downtime. Moving forward, how would you approach the implementation of such monitoring systems to ensure that you can respond quickly to any issues that arise with your data collection processes in future projects? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. So in future, but it's I know typically in professional setup, uh, Century is used to check what kind type of errors are occurring, what is the frequency of occurrence, and, uh, what is the severity severity of those. You have to have some certain markers to to evaluate the severity frequency and everything. And those all those errors are logged into century. You you daily have a look at it, see what is severe, what needs are, what needs are you measured look into. And I know in typical larger teams, there are there are on call engineers to deal with certain scenarios, uh, but, uh, but, uh, that's how I would I would go. Like, that depends totally on the scale of the project. So daily, we would we were generating around 200 organic post, and at at our sorry. At my skill, uh, this was not a severe requirement, but, uh, but but usually in a professional setup, in a larger organization, I know there are centuries being locked into and, uh, those centuries then have a level wise alert. So sometimes it's a email alert, then it's a phone call alert to the engineer. And then then at the highest level, I think there is there has to be an on call engineer in which personally calls up, uh, the concerned person who fixes the issue if he's not able to fix on his own. So, yep, that's that's that's about my answer.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a solid plan for scaling up error monitoring and response mechanisms. Utilizing tools like Sentry for error logging and having a tiered alert system can indeed help manage and mitigate issues effectively. Given your experience and the scale of your projects, how do you balance the need for such robust systems with the resources available, especially in a startup environment where you might have constraints on time and manpower? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yep. Absolutely. Correct. The first thing I being a being a product manager first thing I see like how much impact can a mistake create on our end consumer? So if it's a little payment related system or if it's related to to let's say the user posting those are severe things because without them user cannot interact with the product itself or they have like high repercussions. So for those things definitely the trigger threshold has to be much lower if there is any mistake like that has to be dealt with immediately, but the current example which I recently talked about if I'm populating Marketplace from organic communities, that's not a very, you know, very high negative impact use case or scenario or if there are no organic post generated from our online community. That's not going to cause any havoc in any users personal life. They can still use the product naturally without any automated Marketing in world. So in that scenario like that. Then you not be immediate engineering input to be input to be given and another thing like few things to make sure that like depending on the stage of the product. I like particularly for the initial stage products. I do prefer working with full stack developers who kind of know automation front and backend in order to make this systems in lesser type. But even before that I'll see from user effective how much negative impact can certainly make and then that the work. If it's if it's too much for the team too much for the reason not going to impact and user anyway in a very negative manner. So that's how I would like this is a multiple faceted thinking like whether it's a user impact causing or not and whether our team can deliver it or not and then one one Midway approach. I found like usually full stack developers up really fast implemented. So who helped me ensure that I have a very robust system in a minimal effort in more.\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Can you walk me through the specific challenges you faced while managing the BBPS product lifecycle at Bajaj Finance, and how you addressed them?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Sure. So, uh, bill payments, uh, is a product that is created by NPCI. And then the architecture is built in such a beautiful way wherein 5 major players are working with, uh, around 22,000 odd billers. Those are live on the platform as as we speak today. The challenges that we face on day to day basis, uh, is on the side of every day there is some or the other biller, uh, you know, top performing billers are fluctuating because of their technical issues. So it includes some migration activity that they are doing it, uh, maybe some new changes or new enhancement that they are doing it, or some issues with their operating units, biller operating units, or the customer operating units. So all those types of challenges that we face on day to day basis. Now coming on to the site, how do we tackle this, uh, challenge is, uh, by implementing. So as per the compliance, uh, we are, uh, an agent institute, and an agent institute can have, uh, 2 operating 2 customer operating units. So we have our onboarded additional, uh, you know, customer operating, uh, unit that is allowing us to at least, uh, you know, reduce our failures by 10 percents by, you know, orchestrating the traffic from 1 o u to the other in the real time as soon as we, uh, reaches, uh, the failure reaches the defined thresholds.\n'], [""Interviewer: That's a comprehensive overview of the challenges with biller fluctuations and the solutions you've implemented. Regarding the orchestration system you mentioned, how did you ensure the real-time traffic orchestration maintained high availability and reliability, especially during peak transaction periods?  \n"", ""Interviewee: So, uh, there are 2 peak periods that we, uh, are, uh, that we usually have. Uh, one is around somewhere between 9 to 12 a PM sorry, AM. And second one is around 4 to 9 PM. So these are the 2, uh, traffic, uh, you know, uh, peak period at which, uh, the traffic is at the max. Now coming on to the how orchestrator works is on the side of the, you know, uh, we have, um, identified that, uh, failure, uh, rates during these peak times. And at these peak times, uh, we define that this is the minimum threshold at which the orchestrator should start dynamically routing the traffic in a, uh, you know, batch manner wherein 10%, 20%, 30% traffic starts getting routed to the, uh, second OU. And this happens at a biller level. So it is comprehensive to biller. As soon as the threshold of let's suppose 95% is the threshold, uh, the the success rate goes below 95%, the 10% traffic goes start, you know, uh, shifting to the uh, other overview that we have.

So we have a real time Power BI dashboards that allow us to, you know, see the numbers that are happening in real time. And New Relic helps us in analyzing the performance of the, uh, key, uh, mobile applications or, uh, front end or back end applications that we are running in order to keep these transactions smoothly. So as soon as the threshold goes beyond, so we have our monitoring team, uh, those, uh, you know, that works directly with the technical team. And there are some other mechanisms that are built in place, uh, wherein the escalations are followed as soon as if the issue is not resolved within x period of time, then the issue gets escalated to the, uh, l two d.

Now coming on to the technical decline piece, we have identified certain issues which are, uh, already defined that this could be happening because of, uh, certain reasons. Okay? So for example, there is a migration activity that has been already informed by our operating unit. So for those, uh, the alert mechanism is already, uh, made in such a way wherein we uh, made the changes at the back end that during this period, the biller will not be monitored for for certain types of error. So migration related error codes or certain error codes that are already being identified in the technical declines, which are maintained in an exclusion list in order to reduce the, you know, uh, fake monitoring mails or, uh, alert mechanisms.

Shifting focus a bit, you mentioned leading the development of a BNPL platform at Mswipe Technologies. Can you elaborate on the key technical considerations you had to address to ensure the platform's scalability and security, particularly in the context of integrating with a large number of merchants' systems?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Sure. So, uh, AM Swipe, uh, we were working with, uh, you know, uh, close to 7 or 8, uh, major issuers that are there in India. Apart from that, we our business team was closely, you know, onboarding the top uh, OEMs that are there. So we had around 14 OEMs, and the platform was built for curating the offers for the merchants, those who are, you know, directly working with the, uh, OEMs. So for example, Samsung being the brand, they have already 5,000 merchants that are there. Now they want to roll out some offer on the newly launched phone wherein the 10% discount will be given if the phone is purchased via ICICI Bank credit card. And, uh, the offer is available for a no cost EMI product. So all those configurations are built in that VNPL portal that allowed our OEMs and, uh, issuers to, you know, provide a joint offer to the merchant, which later on can, uh, uh, provide this offer to the end user who is buy who is purchasing the purchasing the project, uh, product of that particular OEM. So this included the 3 types of subvention mechanisms augmented by the issuer, subvention by the brand, and subvention by the merchant. So all 3 types of and mix of 3 was given wherein if issuer and OEM want to, uh, submit the product or merchant and brand want to submit it, the all the types of combinations were built in such a way wherein whatever the type of combination that is coming up, uh, can be taken up on the portal. Apart from that, the portal was uh, made in such a way wherein we were planning to offer it to the players, similar merchant acquiring players, those who are there in the market. Their focus is not more on the technology side. However, their focus was more on the business side, likes of the bank. So the bank focuses on, you know, retaining the customer, activating the customer while not working much on the technology side. So we used to provide our platform in order to increase the scalability of our product.\n'], ['Interviewer: Given the complex nature of these joint offers and the need to support multiple submission mechanisms, how did you approach the design of the BNPL platform to ensure it remained flexible and easily configurable without requiring extensive rework for each new type of offer or submission process?  \n', 'Interviewee: So, primarily, there are 4 to 5 types of offer that, uh, usually works in the BNPL space, wherein the subvention is offered by the OEM. So it could be a percentage wise or it could be a flat offer. Then similar type of offer can be offered by the uh, issuer. Okay. These are the majorly two types of, uh, the I mean, these 2 types or 3 types or combination of these 3 types of offers consist or contributes to the 90% of the types of offer that are getting currently created in BNPL space. Now coming on from issuer side, that that they usually allow 3 types of, uh, you know, EMI option. 1 is no cost EMI. 2nd is, uh, EMI with some different, uh, you know, service fees that they want to charge. Then 3rd comes service fees plus, uh, some interest being charged on the EMI. So all these types of exclusive combination of offers were being taken up from the OEMs and, uh, the issuers. Apart from that, uh, we did some, uh, competitive analysis from the players, likes of Pinelabs, what they are doing because they have the, you know, largest market share in terms of the space that we were working in. So within this, uh, basis, the competitive benchmarking and experience from OEMs and issuers, we had exclusive list of offers, and we build the platform in such a way wherein the combination of a plus b plus c are, uh, you know, uh, around 28 parameters that were defined.

Once the file is shared, then only the funds transfer will happen from brand, uh, to the issuer slash to the, uh, to to us. So that's how, uh, we use to ensure that before making any partner slash brand life, we need to we used to take, you know, confirmation from the brand that whatever the transaction files, whatever the transaction details that they will require in order to perform the reconciliation, uh, we used to do that. Then for phase 1 and and we used to launch the particular brands in a phase manner wherein only 10 to 20 merchants are being enabled on the platform for our 1st month. Once that is done, once confidence is built, then we use to scale it to 1,000 of the merchants as per the brand's confidence.\n""], [""Interviewer: The phased approach to onboarding and transaction verification seems robust. Shifting focus to your technical skills, you've listed New Relic and Content Square on your resume. Can you explain how you've utilized Content Square to gain insights into user behavior and inform product decisions, particularly in the context of the digital payment solutions you've managed?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. So Content Square, uh, we implemented on my 2 of the products, which was Instaemy Card and, uh, BBPS website. The main intention was to see how why the users were exiting from the each step of the funnel. So we we used a sunburst chart in order to see why users are exiting. So we identified that headers and footers as the had the maximum exit points. So we disabled those exit points and maintain the contact so that content relevant so that user can read and take the informed decision. That was one of the activity that we did. Apart from that, we identified that there were high risk claim that was happening on a contact icon that was given. So the intention of the user was to see the list of the content that that can be populated. So all those issues were identified using ContentSquare, uh, Sunburst charts by identifying the respective step of the funnel and the percent as of the exit that are happening. So that's how we used, uh, ContentSquare and increased our 2% improvement in the funnel.\n""], ['Interviewer: Your use of Content Square for user experience optimization is quite innovative. How did you measure the impact of these changes, particularly the redesign of the contact page, on conversion rates and user engagement, and what were the key metrics you used to evaluate success?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So the analysis period was the one wherein, uh, in the 1st month in the in 1 month, we identified there are, let's suppose, x number of clicks, so those are happening. From when user is landing from x one page to the x two page, there are a defined, you know, percentage of let's suppose 10% users are, you know, unable to, uh, are getting exited in the uh, x one page itself, and 90% user are landing on x 2. From x 2 to x 3 only, 80% of, uh, the x 2 users are landing, so 20% drop off is there. So there was a metrics was defined when that we used to track on daily basis what is the behavior of the funnel. Okay. When we launched a new feature wherein the user need to fill the complete form, uh, there were some header and footer designs that were changed. So we started to identify that there is a increase of 2 to 3 percent of exits, uh, at each step of the funnel. So, uh, once these issues are identified, we saw some user experience videos wherein user were getting exited, user were clicking on, uh, some icons which were nonapplicable. So those were identified in the month 1. In m 2, we implemented those changes. We monitored it for a month. In the similar way, the way we were monitoring it for the m one. We we particularly check, you know, hundreds of videos in order to see why user is clicking it. We started calling. We tried to understand why user wants to click on the icon. What are the expectations? So basis there, the changes were implemented in m 2. Accordingly, in the similar fashion, we tracked down all the defined, uh, KPIs that, uh, were defined at the m one end and specifically on the issues that were identified. So the key KPIs that we identified on the, uh, that we tracked in the m two was on the size of the number of clicks that are happening, how many users are opening the page, what is the total time spent, how many clicks are happening on that particular instance that is being re modified, how many users are spending time on the on respective pages. So these are some of the key parameters that, uh, we started to analyze from m two.\n""], ['Interviewer: The detailed approach to tracking user behavior and engagement through Content Square is impressive. How did you use the data from Content Square to iterate on the design and content of the pages, and what role did user feedback play in this iterative process?  \n', 'Interviewee: So contact, uh, content square allows us to, you know, uh, see the heat map of the page at what section of the page user is interacting or spending most of the most of the time, uh, during the journey. Then we started to, you know, cap start to capture the feedback as soon as user is planning to exit from the page. So that help that helped us in identifying what is the user expectation on that particular piece. Apart from that, whatever the changes, if we have made it, we used to man analyze it using, uh, by seeing the user, uh, videos, uh, basis that, uh, the identifications were done, uh, whether the changes has been made in customer convenience or not.\n'], ['Interviewer: Incorporating heatmaps and user feedback from Content Square for design iterations and evaluating changes through user videos is a comprehensive UX strategy. How do you ensure that the technical integrations with these tools, such as Content Square and New Relic, are robust and do not significantly impact the performance of the applications they are monitoring?  \n', 'Interviewee: So whatever the, uh, scripts that we were implementing for New Relic and ContentSquare, we had, you know, various tools, uh, that we use to identify the impact of these scripts. So first one was, uh, website tracking tools that were there, wherein as soon as we used to identify there are some extensions that we are putting in. Apart from that, we had our, uh, infosec team that used to identify if there is any, uh, extra script that are being, uh, put in place. 2nd. 3rd thing that we used to do is via New Relic, we used to identify the CLP, f, uh, FCP, LCP. Uh, these are some of the parameters that helped us in understanding why the largest component of the page is not loading, why first input delay is there. So all those, uh, core web vitals were used to were being, uh, monitored using, uh, New Relic for other type of different types of scripts that we are putting in. Apart from that, there are some extensions that were provided by Google, uh, that were used to see the, you know, page loading performance, uh, after implementing various scripts on the website.\n'], ['Interviewer: Monitoring tools like New Relic for Core Web Vitals and using website tracking tools to assess the impact of third-party scripts is a solid approach. How do you approach the optimization of front-end and back-end integrations to ensure that the application remains responsive and efficient, especially in the context of the additional integrations you might have to manage for new features or services?  \n', ""Interviewee: Uh, John, I have not worked on direct implementations of these scripts. When I were given these these products, uh, these scripts are already integrated. So I don't have much knowledge about it.\n""], [""Interviewer: I understand the pre-existing nature of the integrations with monitoring and analytics tools. Given your experience with managing these tools in a monitoring capacity, how do you envision leveraging their data and insights to inform proactive decision-making in product management, particularly in identifying areas for enhancement or addressing potential performance bottlenecks in the application's integrations?  \n"", 'Interviewee: So as I mentioned that we have some powerbear dashboards created for our business kpis or business numbers tracking. In parallel to that we have some dashboards created for our you know key performance of our backend and front end systems. Now there were certain around 10 to 12 API is that are being consumed in the applications? And in that we identified in the business decline out of the 30000 errors on basis. We saw that 20,000 errors are happening because we were prefilling some. Customer information. That was the mobile number that we are assumption that it would be user convenience. But when we see when we saw the data that 20,000 failures are happening because of the error called invalid slasher incorrect customer details and So that was one of the customer details that customer need to enter along with the some customer ID or other parameters whenever the bill was fetched. The customer was getting this error. So when we started to, you know, stop prefilling the mobile number and we gave a contact icon on click office. The contactless can be open in the mobile number can be seen. So once this this issue was identified by Me by analyzing the data that what is happening after speaking to the customer seeing the different videos that customers. Not checking the mobile number is considering that whatever the number is being populated is the correct one and is proceeding after entering the other customer parameter and the error was getting there. So after identifying this we stopped refilling the mobile number and that because of that we were able to reduce the 60% of the total errors that were happening. So this is one of the classic example of I use the data in order to improve the performance of the system.\n'], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

I'm ready.\n""], [""Interviewer: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you tell me a bit about your most recent role and how it has prepared you for the position of Product Manager? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Most recently, uh, I'm a product lead, uh, at a stealth mode startup where I'm making a marketplace, uh, for Indian transporters transport SMBs. So one interest some of the interesting aspects about of it are I did not use any marketing budget, so there was no performance marketing involved. There was there were no paid ads. All the growth has been purely organic and through growth hacks. Uh, so there was some, uh, growth loops which I had embedded into product, which included organic communities. So I was reading organic communities, uh, through AI agent and then converting those, uh, things onto my application, uh, so that my transport marketplace was automatically populated with organic genuine post. Uh, that's how I bootstrapped it and and generated a significant traction in short span without spending any, uh, you know, marketing thing. So the that that that that's about my my recent rule. I used, like, AI agent, open APIs. I I designed a very significantly better interface than than what what the existing computers are in the market are doing. And then one innovation was, like, reading organic communities through a WhatsApp bot and then, uh, converting those push into an organic push on onto the application. So these three were the, like, key elements of it. Um, I mean, that that that's an\n""], [""Interviewer: That's quite impressive, leveraging organic growth and AI to drive user engagement without a marketing budget. Given your experience with AI agents and APIs, how did you ensure that the data being scraped and used in your marketplace was reliable and respected user privacy, especially considering the sensitivity around transportation logistics? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Correct. So few things were there. Although I was using AI agent to populate my marketplace, uh, there was still a manual intervention just to make sure that, uh, like, all the data which is going into the my system is accurate. Uh, another thing, I had written some more APIs on top of it in order to validate whatever information I'm putting it. It's not considering like, having any sensitive information, any user specific information, which is automatically lead to our, uh, UI. So I had, like, multiple APIs on top of another or to validate those things. Um, in addition, I had, like, a person dedicated just to keep a watch over, uh, the organic post generated on the platform. If there is any mishap, like, you can immediately delete it, uh, with with the manual control. So these two things. Like, there were, like, couple of more AI kind of agent APIs which which, uh, made sure that every post is validated strongly against our set of criteria. And then on top of it, there was a manual, uh, checking as well. Uh, Yeah. These two things were were ensure, uh, like, ensured. And another thing was, uh, on our marketplace itself, we were making sure that the user personal information, which which are their phone numbers or any any name, that sort of thing, that is hidden from, uh, from the the the other marketplace users on the application until they submit their own information. So the way we ensure this, like like, uh, as I talk talked about, there was another top of APIs chained to to each other, uh, which ensured that, like, phone numbers is omitted, any personal data is omitted. And for the for that thing also, I use another like like, same open API, like, with another one. Like, ensure that there's no person data or everything, uh, is stripped off and masked from actually displaying on there and the and the end user of of this thing, marketplace postings. So, yep, uh, that that's how I dealt about it.\n""], [""Interviewer: It sounds like you've implemented a robust system combining automated checks with manual oversight to maintain data integrity and privacy. Shifting focus to your design skills, you mentioned creating a significantly better interface. Can you walk me through your design process using Figma, and how you ensured that the user experience was aligned with the needs of your transporters and SMBs? \n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. Uh, so the thing is, uh, right now, I mean, if you want, I can show you, uh, the, um, like, my Figma sketches, but, uh, I'm not sure, like, I would be able to access those files right at the moment, but then I'll explain you the thought process. The thought process was, uh, ensuring what Indian transport SMEs typically prefer. They prefer WhatsApp US. They prefer coming their communication happening with mobile phone over any other apps. So I made sure that our app UI is very coherent with what what WhatsApp UI is and what call logs are. So they kind of feel this app is natural extension to what they have already been using. They they use typically phone calls and, like, in the personal connections. Uh, so one key, uh, feature was, uh, like, instead of having multiple, you know, multiple sections of that which they have to learn and explore, Uh, we kind of did a a call log kind of test in which, uh, the whole UI appeared as if, like, it was a series of call log interactions with other users. So there was post, there was track, there was, you know, call call made, call received. That type of interaction on a unified interface, uh, makes it very interesting for somehow, like, for the, uh, Indian consumers, uh, the transport SMBs. They don't like uh, want to learn different subsections and subsections of, uh, like like, you have typically, what a competitor would do is, uh, like like, what what other competitive apps are doing is they are they're having like, there is a top marketplace. There is a loan marketplace. Uh, then there is my load section, my truck section. Like, 4, 5 sections, it it's placed into it. But, no, but what why users are preferring online communities? Because it feels like a live interaction. Uh, like, one thing after another, not not necessarily categorized into different things. So that's that that's how we leverage our UI insights.\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to UI design is very user-centric, focusing on familiarity and ease of use by mirroring popular communication apps like WhatsApp. Given that you've tailored the experience for Indian transport SMBs, how did you incorporate feedback loops into your product development process to ensure that the features you were building were actually meeting the needs of your users? And how did you prioritize which features to develop next? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yep. So the thing is, uh, we had periodic feedback loops even before the product was launched. Uh, what what I would do is, like, prototype a thing in Figma and then actually take it to the local transporters and see like, without mentioning it to them that this is just a prototype and not an actual application, just see how they try to interact with that that screen. And, actually, record a screen, uh, you know, tabs and, uh, like, the way they're where they click and what their facial expressions are. I used to, like, notice it and then later studied, like, think thinking where did they feel actually confused or where did they were they were, like, encouraged to click on certain things. Um, that's how that's how I ensured, like, the the feedback loop loop was, uh, involved. Uh, I'm sorry. What was your what was your second question? I think you asked 2 questions. 1 was the feedback loop. How how did I incur incorporate? And what was the second question?\n""], ['Interviewer: No problem at all. The second part of my question was about how you prioritized which features to develop next based on the feedback you received and the data you collected. Could you elaborate on your process for feature prioritization in the context of your product management? \n', 'Interviewee: Could you elaborate on your process for feature prioritization in the context of your product management? Yep. Yep. So\n'], ['Interviewer: I understand that you agree with the user-centric approach, but could you elaborate on how you collected and integrated user feedback into your product development cycle? Additionally, what criteria did you use to decide which features to prioritize for development? \n', ""Interviewee: Yep. Correct. So one one is the traditional way of looking at it. Like, there is a a rise model evaluating, uh, which features are, like, the first to take. And, uh, I think that typically takes, uh, few things into consideration. How much is the effort involved? Uh, how much is the possible impact? Like, scoring some arbitrary numbers to it and checking the ratio of impact divided by effort, uh, and and then multiplying it with the possible reach of a particular solution. So that's how we would rank the the features, which feature to dial up first. And another thing is particularly one thing I personally try to use is, uh, uh, I have to check whether the value proposition of a particular solution or feature is significantly higher because this was a new product. So the value proposition had to be significantly higher than, uh, what the competing products are are available in the market. So it can't just be a better UI. So, uh, that that that that these are the 2 metrics, uh, or two parameters based on which I decided which features to build first. 1 was the first one was the value proposition, and second one was traditional ranking. How would you rank, uh, which which features are, like, uh, should be developed first? And then, uh, I mean, uh, for value proposition, I might go into little bit more elaborate. Like, you need to have, like, 2, 3, 4 times more better value proposition than than the existing competitive, uh, products. And then that's when users switch from current behavior to a new behavior. Uh, I think this is, uh, this is kind of, like, a little bit known theory of delta for value proposition. If there is a delta for value proposition in your product, then people like like, the the new behavior is 4 times better than the previous behavior, then then people are, like, naturally inclined to switch to the new behavior and not switch back to whatever the old behavior is. So these these two things. Yep. Rise model and value proposition.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a very strategic approach, utilizing the RICE model for effort versus impact analysis and the Delta 4 theory to ensure that your product stands out in the market. Given your technical background, how did you communicate these technical and product decisions to your development team, and how did you ensure that the technical aspects were aligned with the product vision and user needs? \n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. So few things we ensured, like, one one was, like, we ensured which part of the UI needs pixel perfection, which parts are, like, okay to, you know, change a little bit. For example, let's say on if you want to copy WhatsApp UI, it's good enough to copy the text messaging part and and, you you know, usual, uh, the color the color and theme, but don't have to go as detailed as, like, you know, making sure that the doodles used on WhatsApp are the same what what we are using on our app. So, uh, that's how I would communicate the user details, uh, to the design team that to ensure that, like, you have to make sure that which parts are, like, must have and which parts are, like, okay to kind of go a little bit vague about. As far as the technical team, I being, uh, being from an engineering background, I would I would make a detailed specification about which programs are to be done, which APIs are to be done, what input data is expected, what output data is expected. Uh, that kind of, like, API level specification and what automations are need to be done, uh, these kind of things which we, uh, which I give information to the tech team. And I also help on, like, which tool to pick. Let's say, uh, if you're, uh, doing browser Chrome automation, like, how to use JavaScript tool and selenium tool, you know, combine that automation and, like, which which libraries are best utilized and, uh, to open API, uh, availability and all those things. I made sure that the tech team does not have to think about, uh, which frameworks to use or even, uh, what what are the API specification. They just had to focus on what what was the core task given to them. And I I made sure that they they they get all the technical details.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that you have a strong grasp on both the design and technical aspects of product development, and you're able to effectively bridge the gap between the two. Considering your experience with web scraping and automation, how did you handle challenges related to data consistency and the potential for web scraping to break due to changes in the target websites? How did you ensure the resilience of your data collection methods? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yep. So, uh, being a new product and a new process, uh, we were not, like, very, uh, strict initially about, uh, what the consistency, let's say, data collection process, what if the the UI, uh, code itself on the website changes. So that particular part, let's say, if UI of, uh, like, the the HTML code are are changing on the the on on the WhatsApp side, like, the data collection may not be accurate. That part was honestly manual. Like, if there was a like, if program broke, then we we saw saw into the program and then then and then and then fixed that. And another another thing about, like, the consistency and everything, I as I already told before that uh, we had, like, couple of more edge AI agents to validate every post which were which were reading into our system. So these 2, uh, if, uh, the the about the web acceptance that, uh, code on the in on on on the website being chain and then that is impacting our data collection, we had checks in places to make sure that if such thing happens, we have to manually intervene and check which code or which usually, the the the these changes are really minor. Like, usually, some HTML tags, uh, do get changed on on the client website. Um, so those changes we will do manually, uh, check again what what what's the new updated code code and then just do it. As far as the exact content which we are reading, we had validation and already in place to ensure that those are relevant to our marketplace.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's good to hear that you had a validation process in place to maintain data quality. Given the manual aspect of handling changes in web scraping targets, did you implement any alerting mechanisms to detect when a scrape failed or when data quality issues arose? How did you manage to keep the downtime to a minimum in such scenarios? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Yes. So, uh, like, this was little bit hacky in a way that, uh, whenever the program kind of failed to read, uh, any organic post, uh, after multiple iterations, uh, and then failed to read. I don't mean to say, like, there was no organic push at all. The program broke in a sense that the element which you're searching for is not found, let's say. That's when you know that certain thing has been broken on our server. At that time, I'm I made a alert on on our Telegram, which would, uh, which would like like, it would send me a Telegram message that, uh, hey, Pawan, uh, something has broken because we're not able to read a particular element on this website, uh, HTML. That's how, uh, that's how we'll do. Uh, I I I would want to ensure that this was her part of the plan, but I did not actually end up implementing in the product because of the, you know, uh, constraints of time. But this was originally, uh, one of my plan or PRDs to ensure that we have a very high uptime, ensuring that sometimes whenever whenever there is a change in the client side and we are not able to find the element itself to read the data form, uh, we would get our Telegram alert. So I had a PRD prepared for it, but, technically, we do not end up implementing.\n""], [""Interviewer: I see, so you had a proactive approach in mind with the telegram alerts for monitoring the web scraping process. Even though it wasn't implemented, it's a sound strategy for minimizing downtime. Moving forward, how would you approach the implementation of such monitoring systems to ensure that you can respond quickly to any issues that arise with your data collection processes in future projects? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. So in future, but it's I know typically in professional setup, uh, Century is used to check what kind type of errors are occurring, what is the frequency of occurrence, and, uh, what is the severity severity of those. You have to have some certain markers to to evaluate the severity frequency and everything. And those all those errors are logged into century. You you daily have a look at it, see what is severe, what needs are, what needs are you measured look into. And I know in typical larger teams, there are there are on call engineers to deal with certain scenarios, uh, but, uh, but, uh, that's how I would I would go. Like, that depends totally on the scale of the project. So daily, we would we were generating around 200 organic post, and at at our sorry. At my skill, uh, this was not a severe requirement, but, uh, but but usually in a professional setup, in a larger organization, I know there are centuries being locked into and, uh, those centuries then have a level wise alert. So sometimes it's a email alert, then it's a phone call alert to the engineer. And then then at the highest level, I think there is there has to be an on call engineer in which personally calls up, uh, the concerned person who fixes the issue if he's not able to fix on his own. So, yep, that's that's that's about my answer.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a solid plan for scaling up error monitoring and response mechanisms. Utilizing tools like Sentry for error logging and having a tiered alert system can indeed help manage and mitigate issues effectively. Given your experience and the scale of your projects, how do you balance the need for such robust systems with the resources available, especially in a startup environment where you might have constraints on time and manpower? \n"", ""Interviewee: Yep. Absolutely. Correct. The first thing I being a being a product manager first thing I see like how much impact can a mistake create on our end consumer? So if it's a little payment related system or if it's related to to let's say the user posting those are severe things because without them user cannot interact with the product itself or they have like high repercussions. So for those things definitely the trigger threshold has to be much lower if there is any mistake like that has to be dealt with immediately, but the current example which I recently talked about if I'm populating Marketplace from organic communities, that's not a very, you know, very high negative impact use case or scenario or if there are no organic post generated from our online community. That's not going to cause any havoc in any users personal life. They can still use the product naturally without any automated Marketing in world. So in that scenario like that. Then you not be immediate engineering input to be input to be given and another thing like few things to make sure that like depending on the stage of the product. I like particularly for the initial stage products. I do prefer working with full stack developers who kind of know automation front and backend in order to make this systems in lesser type. But even before that I'll see from user effective how much negative impact can certainly make and then that the work. If it's if it's too much for the team too much for the reason not going to impact and user anyway in a very negative manner. So that's how I would like this is a multiple faceted thinking like whether it's a user impact causing or not and whether our team can deliver it or not and then one one Midway approach. I found like usually full stack developers up really fast implemented. So who helped me ensure that I have a very robust system in a minimal effort in more.\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

So they actually productively, uh, contributed to the automation, uh, drive.\n'], ['Interviewer: Training team collaboration sounds crucial. How did you measure the effectiveness of this training program, and what adjustments did you make based on those measurements?  \n', 'Interviewee: Those measurements. Yeah. Uh, so, uh, we evaluated the team members, uh, by having assessment, by giving them assessment after each module. So the training was actually, uh, um, cut into, like, uh, 3 or 4 pieces of training. Initial introduction and, uh, the other parts of technical, uh, tool training. So for each phase, we had assessment. So wherein we came to know the team members where they had the weakness. And that way, the training was helpful by the assessment, particular assessment. And, also, we had a test drive wherein, uh, team members were made to work on the test, uh, cases. That way, we understood where the strengths and what they further need to be trained.\n'], [""Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach to training evaluation. Shifting focus a bit, you've also worked on metrics management and ensuring SLA compliance. Can you discuss the key metrics you tracked for a project and how you used that data to maintain SLA compliance?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Compliance. Yeah. So the key metrics that I have, uh, tracked during the project is productivity and quality. So those 2 are the major metrics, uh, which contributes to about, uh, 30 percentage and 30 percentage. Overall, 60 percentage goes to productivity and quality. And other metrics is apart from that where, uh, the customer satisfaction scores that we get from the, uh, clients and also the, uh, utilization of the team team utilization, how they do their productivity on a daily basis, and the compliance part and security part. So these are all the metrics that I have, uh, tracked. And, specifically, uh, also, we gave some points to the, uh, assessment scores from the training. So overall, contributed to 100%. That's how we track the metrics.\n""], ['Interviewer: Focusing on productivity and quality makes sense. How did you ensure that the team remained focused on these key metrics, especially during high-pressure periods, and how was this reflected in your project management approach?  \n', ""Interviewee: Management approach. Yeah. So during, uh, peak peak periods, what we do is, like, uh, conduct some floor activities to ensure that the team members don't get stressed out, especially during the peak period, wherein they have to continuously work on the, uh, system. So some kind of floor activities were planned using the, uh, HR invention, uh, HR intervention. Uh, so human resource team collaboration, we organize some fun activities in the floor wherein it's not a long term activity, but a short activity, which made them feel relaxed and work, uh, confidently on the day. That is one thing. And with regards to project management side, what we did was, like, uh, ensure that they had the feedback given properly at consistent intervals. So giving feedback as part of the quality management tools and QMP, the quality management principles were deployed. So those are all some of the main activities for quality which we did. And for productivity, the matrices were discussed with the team leads or the team members productivity were discussed with the team leads. So they actually helped groom them productivity.\n""], ['Interviewer: Incorporating HR interventions for team morale is innovative. How did you quantify the impact of these HR interventions on team performance, and did you make any adjustments to these activities based on the feedback received from the team?  \n', ""Interviewee: See from the team. Yeah. So for for example, for one of the activity, uh, we did was the floor activity. It's kind of a fun activity, and, uh, the team members, those who are not talking much or not, uh, mingling much with the team members, they were actually voluntarily pulled to ensure that they also speak and, uh, have a good network with the team so that the teamwork, uh, gets stronger. That is one aspect, uh, which which we learned as part of the HR intervention. So HR gave this some of the factors. So picking people who are not much talking or something, which which actually help them to groom their, uh, communication skills also. And, uh, the feedback given was, uh, very quite, uh, this is the feedback. The teamwork was improved.\n""], [""Interviewer: Understanding the impact on team dynamics is insightful. Shifting to a more technical focus, you've listed Quality Assurance as one of your skills. Can you describe a particularly challenging QA issue you've encountered and how you resolved it within a project, focusing on the specific methodologies or tools you employed?  \n"", 'Interviewee: You employed. Yeah. So one of the issues which while working on the project was, uh, there were a number of errors, uh, the team members were making, especially the newcomers and the, uh, freshers. So, uh, a lot of training programs were arranged to overcome these errors. And, uh, they those members were pulled out from the production, and they were deployed into test production wherein we measure their test scores. So gradually, they improve this course week on week and by within 2 weeks, they were able to achieve the, uh, required productivity and I mean, the quality achieve the quality. So the SLA was 95 percentage. They actually contribute at 97 and above, which was a good thing. And other thing which had was we deployed some of the tools like the fishbone diagram, uh, the 80 20 Pareto rule. So fishbone diagram actually, uh, explains the number of errors and how we can, uh, uh, by arrive and control the errors. Error control in the kind of system deployed like fishbone and, uh, 80 20 Pareto rule, concentrating on the major error and so that that actually, uh, reduced much of the other errors.\n'], ['Interviewer: Leveraging training and deployment to test environments is effective. How did you measure the effectiveness of the Fishbone diagram and the 80/20 rule in reducing errors, and were there any unexpected challenges in implementing these methodologies or tools in your QA process?  \n', 'Interviewee: To a process. No. Those tools were, uh, absolutely helpful. And, uh, so we came to know that the number of errors, the type of errors, especially. So for example, numerical errors, typo errors, and conceptual errors, these are all the categorization we had in the error list. So those errors were, um, concentrated, and some of the numerical errors had high impact to the client. So those, uh, diagrams actually help to understand how where the, uh, production team makes the, uh, numerical errors and how we can improve it. So, accordingly, training was arranged as per the, uh, error, uh, the team had. So that actually helped.\n'], ['Interviewer: Understanding the categorization of errors is key to targeted improvement. How did you design the training programs to specifically address the different types of errors, and what was the impact on error reduction for each category after the training initiatives?  \n', 'Interviewee: Training initiatives. Yeah. So the training program was, uh, arranged, uh, in collaboration with the training team. So there was a trainer specifically assigned for this project. So, uh, the trainer was also part of the team. So he knows the key, uh, errors, and he understands the process. So we discussed with him the number of errors the team were making and where, uh, the contribution was high. The chart was discussed there chart. And, accordingly, the training program was arranged, uh, to we had groups specific groups for, uh, different trainings. So each group, uh, not everyone attended all the trainings. So targeted groups were, uh, allocated for specific trainings. For example, numerical errors, we had a separate team. And for typo and the conceptual errors, there are different teams. So those kind of, uh, training arrangements are made, and that was really successful. So once after the training, we tested them, had a written test and online test, and we understood that about 90 percentage of people were able to grasp it and, uh, come through of the training, and 10 percentage, we had a retraining and tested them again. That helped.\n'], ['Interviewer: Targeted training for specific error types is a strategic approach. How did you measure the effectiveness of the training for each group, and what methodologies or tools did you use to conduct the pre and post-training assessments to ensure the 90% grasp rate you mentioned?  \n', 'Interviewee: Break you mentioned. Yeah. So the free training, we had a a questionnaire filled up by the team to understand where they are at the, uh, status quo. So as per the current status, where they were. Uh, after filling the questionnaire, we came to know that, uh, where they were. And, uh, accordingly, the training plan was arranged. So once after the training, we had a post, uh, training questionnaire given to the team. And, uh, we came to know that their training and, uh, their knowledge has improved after the training, definitely. So from the 90 percentage that I mentioned, how I came to know is the, uh, entire team, uh, scores had numerical errors and errors. But after the training, uh, the the out of, uh, 50 people, about 45 people were able to cross the 90 so on percentage quality. From this, we understand that the 90 percentage is achieved.\n'], [""Interviewer: Using pre and post-training questionnaires is a solid assessment method. How about the written and online tests, were they standardized across all groups, and what kind of questions or scenarios were included to evaluate the team's understanding of the material?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Of the material. Yeah. So for this online tests, uh, uh, there were several contributions from, uh, one from the trainer directly and, uh, some from the project managers and the team leads. They gave a lot of questions. The, uh, number of questions were pulled in, and, uh, we arrived at, like, uh, say, a lot of, like, 2 to 3 questions. And from there, we picked randomly picked the for the online questions methodology. So each time the test will keep changing. The not all the same questions will be repeating for the same numbers. So that way, we were able to assure that, uh, each team member had a different questionnaire and, uh, they also understood the concepts clearly.\n'], [""Interviewer: Randomizing the questions ensures a fair assessment of understanding. How did you ensure that the questions covered a wide enough range of scenarios to truly test the team's comprehension, and were there any feedback mechanisms in place for team members to comment on the clarity or effectiveness of the training material based on their test experiences?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Experiences. Yes. So, uh, we also had a feedback mechanism after the test. The trainer actually collected feedback from the team members to understand that, uh, the, uh, online assessment was fair. So we came to know that, like, few questions were, uh, little bit contradicting with the, uh, current process, and, uh, that were actually corrected. So what happened was there were few updates from clients. We used to get the regular updates from client. So those are all the key points. Uh, I think the trainer didn't have a much of connect. So those are corrected based on the feedback. That really helped.\n""], [""Interviewer: Incorporating feedback into the assessment process is a great way to ensure the fairness and relevance of the tests. How did you manage the updates from the client to ensure that the training material remained current and aligned with the evolving processes, and what was the impact of this feedback-driven approach on the team's performance and understanding?  \n"", 'Interviewee: And understanding. Yeah. So, actually, I was the person who was, uh, in charge of the updates and clarification process for the entire project. So what I did was I had a manual updates manual, uh, specifically designed for the project wherein, uh, date wise, as per the project management style, we had, uh, date wise and subject wise, uh, updates manual ready for the team. So it is put in the centralized location where a team was able to go through the manual anytime while they were, uh, processing the, uh, claims or anything. So they were able to get the, uh, recent updates from the client. So this one, we also had daily refreshes in the morning to understand, uh, uh, what the client updates were, and we explained them to the team as well. So both ways really helped.\n'], ['Interviewer: Creating a centralized updates manual is a proactive approach to keeping the team informed. How did you measure the effectiveness of this communication strategy in terms of its impact on error reduction, productivity, and team morale, and were there any challenges in ensuring that the daily refreshes and manual updates remained comprehensive and easily understandable for the team?  \n', 'Interviewee: For the team. Yeah. So, um, what happened was the client used to send in their language through email or during the calls, uh, daily calls, they, uh, mention the updates. So we actually simplify it for the team so that they understand in, uh, simple English. We put it in a way that the team understands it. And, also, we ensure that during the daily refreshes, we talk about the updates and randomly pick, uh, team members to again, uh, talk about the updates to to to understand that they also, uh, know the updates clearly. So that way we reassured that the team had, uh, updates, uh, clearly mentioned, and it was simplified for them.\n'], [""Interviewer: Simplifying client updates for your team is a great strategy to ensure everyone stays on the same page. How do you ensure that the updates are accurately simplified, and what mechanisms do you have in place to verify that the team has understood the updates correctly, and what was the impact of this on the team's performance and understanding?  \n"", 'Interviewee: And understanding. Yeah. So, uh, it is directly impacting in their quality. So what are the updates we get from the client? So, uh, during the weekly quality reports, we, uh, come to know that, uh, if some of the members had done errors on that specific update. So we arranged a training for that team, uh, member. So, um, we came to know that, um, so the team member has not understood the update based on the quality. It is evident in the quality report. So they make errors based on those updates. So they are not aware. Maybe they would have been absent or some of the mechanisms that we had, people who are absent on a particular day, the team lead will, uh, share the updates on the next day, and, also, they mandated them to look at the updates and have a manual for signing to ensure that they have actually, uh, seen the updates and they are aware of it. So the signing mechanism was just followed across the team.\n'], [""Interviewer: Using quality reports to identify and address understanding gaps is a strategic use of data. How do you ensure that the training provided after such incidents is effective in bridging the gap, and do you have any metrics or methods to measure the impact of this targeted training on error reduction and understanding, and how was this reflected in the team's performance and understanding?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Then understanding. So, uh, these trainings were conducted, uh, as I already mentioned for the specific targeted groups. Not everybody were, uh, pulled in the training. So those who had below, uh, 95 percentage SLA were pulled into the training, and they were given assessments and understood, uh, about the current updates and other processes. So after the assessment, if some of the team members didn't achieve the, uh, required, uh, percentage, so they were again assessed and retrained into the concepts and, uh, put into test phase of production. So through test phase of production, what we did was we had a shadowing process. So some of the lead, uh, production team, uh, they were made to shadow and understand how they work. So that way, actually, the shadowing helped them. And the assessment, uh, how it impacted was, there was no issues. After the training assessment, the team were able to give good performance. We evidently saw this.\n""], [""Interviewer: Implementing a shadowing process is a great way to ensure practical understanding. How do you conduct the assessments to ensure that team members are ready to go back to full production, and do you have any specific methods or tools in place to measure their readiness, and how was this readiness reflected in the team's performance and understanding?  \n"", ""Interviewee: And understanding. Yeah. So once, uh, they were put into shadow, uh, shadowing and, uh, in the test case production, what we do is the quality team, uh, assesses their full production. Instead of doing sampling quality, the quality team does a full quality check on their entire week's production. So that way we came to know that where the actual quality is, the average of growing quality, actual quality. So if suppose, uh, we categorized the, uh, percentage as red, uh, green, and yellow amber. So red, if the people follow in red that is below 90 percentage, they will not go into production. They will be further into the test phase for 1 more week. If they were in amber phase between 95 to 97, they'll be put in a controlled production wherein instead of, uh, processing 100 cases, they'll be processing, like, uh, 60 percentage or 50 percentage based on their efficiency. If they were in the green phase, they'll be put into the full production. That's how we, uh, monitor the, um, their production after the, uh, test cases and the training.\n""], [""Interviewer: Using a full quality check after training and shadowing is a rigorous way to ensure readiness. How do you differentiate between the categories (red, amber, green) in terms of the criteria for quality, efficiency, and understanding, and do you have any feedback loops in place to continuously improve the training and onboarding process based on the findings from these assessments, and how has this approach impacted the team's performance and understanding over time?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Here so based on the test scores. The team members were categorized into red Amber and green. So continuously the weekly reports based on the weekly reports even after they go into the full production. They were continuously monitored if they were in green continuously. That's a good sign that they have improved. So somebody moved from Amber to Green that is also a good sign. If somebody moved from the Amber stage to a red that is something which we we need to look upon and again rearrange training for them. So if somebody is continuously on a red and they are not improving they are pulled out of the production. Pulled out of the production and that way we ensure that they don't affect the overall productivity. I mean the overall quality they are full of protection put into complete training. So after that a complete assessment is given even if they didn't improve then we will have to move them to the different team or we look for other options for the particular team member that is a very small percentage which doesn't impact the productivity or quality. And something called Carvey was introduced Caribbean the sense like list of team members for put in the Caribbean list. So all the quality team have specific list of team members where they need to use special attention. So those people have done more sampling quality team will do extra 10% sampling to see how they are qualities for every week and assessment to the production.\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

And that goes from formatting 80 page papers using citations, all the robust functions within Word. But this also extends to PowerPoint, for example, understanding a lot of the macro features in PowerPoint to create a adequate presentation where it's organized You have your notes.

So it shouldn't be something that's shunned or something that shouldn't be used. It should be used to augment the capabilities of an attorney. So I think within the form of legal research, there's boundless capacity for it to be kind of incorporated, and I kinda wanna be on the edge of that because I think it's super important. For example, you know, if I'm researching, a case law, I can do a lot of my case law reading and review. However, that, you know, that's time consuming if I am able to use AI to more accurately track the cases that I need to use for regulatory compliance within a specific circuit within a specific district that's great.

They can pull up cases that are associated with electrical compliance and EV charging. Or it can pull up cases that, are tangentially related to that. So I think the biggest thing in AI is ensuring the accuracy and train of thought versus accuracy within word recognition, whereas the word electric or energy and it pulls up that case as opposed to understanding a deeper idea of what the case is about to incorporate that into the research algorithm would be super important.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your insights into the potential for AI to improve the specificity and relevance of search results in legal research are quite valuable.

So for example, if you're working for a current entity, and that current entity was owned by 3 others understanding those contracts and the provisions that are still operable into the current contract and understanding who you need to get approval from, understanding the different contract components that kind of inhibit certain entity requirements if there's a voter shareholder or there's, different terms or ideas that are used the previous iterations of contracts, making sure they follow the same streamline of thought.

Understanding what to give up and what to give opposing counsel. In terms of drafting an adequate contract that, you know, makes both parties happy. So I'd say the 2 biggest challenges are understanding the previous contract iterations when you're doing due diligence to make sure you're crossing your t's and dotting your i's, making sure a lot of the work is, you know, legal germane and also adhering to previous contracts.

There's no need for an 80 page contract as something could be done in 10. Understanding that all the key provisions are in there, and they're adequately addressed to the point.

It doesn't wanna be know, kind of some nebulous idea, but is it actually stating an idea in our opinion? Then kinda taking a step back from that, has this source been used in other components? Like, if it's being used in legal cases, if it's an expert witness, then it's gonna attach more credibility to that idea. But even diving more into the background of that idea, I think, is important. In establishing the credibility of a source. But if it's just kind of more of a writing source, you gotta be careful with it. You gotta under you know, you gotta trust that if it's coming through a newspaper article, you gotta research the idea, the the journalist making sure that it's intellectually sound. So you know, if it's used in the legal context, it gives you more leeway as opposed to something that you just find on the Internet that's the source.

This interview will consist of basic questions about your background as well as some high-level questions about the skills you listed on your application. Ensure that you minimize long pauses during your responses, otherwise you may be cut off prematurely. Are you ready to start the interview? \n', 'Interviewee: '], [""Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've been working with RLHF AI training. Can you explain the specific challenges you've encountered in this field and how you've addressed them?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Well, I've worked on 2 projects different as a contractor, different outfits. So the first one was data annotation, and the second one's outlier, uh, also known as remote tasks. And, uh, with data, it'll be straightforward. Uh, we just asked to review um, different responses basically based on 2 models. And data annotations, rubric, and criteria for justifying what counts as good and what counts as poor is not as thorough as outlier. Working for Outlier, I've worked in the capacity of creative content writer, of reviewer, so responses from other humans, And also as final editor, that is the the last stage before we send reviewed responses to the. And so the main issues are making sure that criteria from what counts as good and what counts as bad is consistently applied, and it could be objective standards in terms of reasoning or a correct answer in mathematics. Those are pretty straightforward. But then the gray area is to do or involve client preferences and style of writing, which, um, so for example, one client were asked to but not all aspects of AP style are wanted by the client. So it's difficult to know exactly how to get the right consistency, um, and until we get feedback from the client. And we kinda wanna prevent that because having feedback from the client that we might be getting something wrong and it might cause some friction and change it for the contract. So it's basically issues like that of of in terms of applying criteria. The other difficulty, of course, is final editor. When you're at that level of you're the last stage before the client sees the final product, there's a lot of pressure to ensure that you're getting something right. And, you know, the strength of chatbots is when they're trained properly as they as they things right if they're following the right algorithmic rules, etiquette, and so forth. As humans, we're we can overlook things. And so, um, although we tend to be more detailed and critical to looking at written text, more, uh, aware of context and interpretation. It says other things that chatbots do quite well that can be, um, that can be missed by humans. And so that's that's quite stressful and sometimes disappointing when it's missed. But so far, my work with outlier as a reviewer has gone quite well. I consist of very good, uh, ratings or reviews on my review work. Um, you know, every now and then, I might drop the ball a bit because I've missed something. But all in all, it's it's going quite well. And, um, I enjoy the work as long as the team with which I'm working design the criteria or come up with the criteria, they're pretty clear with and so far with Outlaw, it's been great. I'm I'm, you know, on a weekly basis touch with humans and man line managers and tech people. As with data annotation, you're rarely in touch with a human. And so it's a it's a bit\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It sounds like you've dealt with a wide range of challenges, especially in maintaining consistency and meeting client preferences. How do you approach the initial design of evaluation criteria to ensure they are clear and objective, particularly in areas where subjectivity might come into play?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: It depends on the prompt and the chat history. I think, um, the best way to there's no one size fits all, but, um, I think Outlier has a pretty good system where we prioritize the chat. So anything brought up in the chat history is seen as to have a ranking preference over how it's as being good in the final months where we're um, so for example, if it can be anything from formatting. So if the chat history has a specific kind of formatting that might be but is used throughout, then we'll we'll apply that to the final response that we're rating. Um, if it's, um, you know, a chat history that's looking at multiple choice questions, we look at the way in which it's answering, um, how it explains the correct answer, and whether or not it explains why the other answers are incorrect. So chat issue is a good thing to go on. And then, um, if, uh, subjectivity might involve ranking or rating a creative piece that has to do with poetry or rewriting a song or rewriting a short story, and there's let's say there's no chat issue to go on, then I apply my expertise and research skills, my academic and humanities, looking for things like, um, are are is the imagery consistent? Structures developed well enough according to the, uh, the remit. Um, you know, it might be a a just a paragraph from a short story because you get turns. But there are ways to apply experience and background to make sure that, in general, responses are consistent, whether it's logical logical consistency or narrative consistency or formatting or structuring consistency, spelling consist and so forth, and making sure that things are clearly explained or catered or elaborated where they need where they in order to give the, uh, user of the prompt the right information or what's often generally the best way to think about it is is the response help to the user? And if it's somewhat helpful, more helpful, or is it does go above and beyond what the expecting and would love to to reach?\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach of leveraging chat history for context and then applying a mix of objective and subjective criteria based on the type of response is quite insightful. Shifting focus a bit, can you discuss a specific project where you had to significantly revise the evaluation criteria based on feedback from the client, and how you managed that process to ensure a smooth transition for the team?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. There are several respond that, um, I guess, intuitively and beyond intuitively, um, from my own experience that I think are right. Um, a lot of it actually, you know, a lot of it does not have stand of content, um, and that's because if there is a prompt or a response that involves a topic that is outside my remit, whether it's coding, very specific about STEM. Um, I won't take the time to try and research it. There's kind of no point anyone else, uh, who is in my role that can do that. Every now and then, you'll get prompts that involve some expertise, but they can be researched. And outlier is pretty good at allowing for that time frame to for us to do that. But most of the, I guess, most of the contentious points come with the that have to do with style and structure. And it's because things like grammar, um, they're they're kind of a way that there are there's there are some core sets of what constitutes good grammar and syntax. And then there are finer points of style that, uh, tend to, uh, be debatable, and they vary across AP style to MLA to Chicago. And, um, everyone, because of their experience and anchoring bias, will have a particular leaning about what towards, you know, what they count to think is good style, whether it's including them or not. So a lot of times, I think in dealing with feedback, whether it's from the client indirectly, because we don't deal with the client directly, or, uh, through the line manager or trainer, and they call you out as the phrase goes for, um, you know, you got this wrong. This needs improvement. And, of course, you'd like to think as an expert in the field, uh, okay. Fine. I'm open to learning and improvement, but, you know, that, you know, that goes against my my understanding of what AP style is. And so I think we I had a little debate with my line manager about the use of the m dash. And that's as hot as it gets, and it's always a friendly conversation. But, um, I I think it's it's it's a funny thing that the most contentious bits have to do with the small minor details as opposed to substandard content. And, again, because the stakes are so big with content, it's either gonna be I know how to do this or I don't know how to do this, or or maybe I I might have missed something case when a points it out or the final editor points it out. It's usually in a good way. You know, great response except you missed this aspect or this aspect isn't with the theory you've you've outlined. Fine. Great. Those good catches, and and I don't mind those. But the smaller thing produce the more interesting conversations.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's interesting to hear about the nuanced challenges you face, especially in the realm of style and structure. Given the importance of these details, how do you ensure that your team stays updated and aligned on the evolving standards, such as those related to style guides like AP or Chicago?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Question. Thank you, uh, Merp AI. Uh, so let me just compare it to my other employer, um, where there is they have a very laissez faire or loose fitting way of of, um, of monitoring the the reviewers. And, basically, it's almost I don't know how they they they judge the quality of the reviewers. I don't know if they call reviewers out and say you can no longer work on this project. But what's great about Outlier is that, um, uh, at least the team I work on and I I will emphasize. So there's there's thousands of contractors that work for them. But I've been able to slot myself into a small team where I was part of a final editing team for one of their big clients. And it was a it was a team of about 10 of us that were reviewing the final the the reviewing the final responses before they went to the client to make estimates for them. Um, and what's great about the process is that it there's always open open lines of communication, whether it's through something like or whether it's through email. And, uh, training managers are more than happy to jump on a call with you, uh, if they have the time to do so. What's great about outlier is that, um, during that project, they were having at least once a week meetings between the reviewers to get everybody on board to see what what the pain points were, what are some of the problems, how can we be consistent on it. So what we do is basically having a transparent open form of communication. People who are mediating the the lines of communication are not only up to speed on, you know, what whatever the criteria are, but also open and communicate that helps things move along.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that effective communication and regular team meetings play a crucial role in maintaining consistency and quality. How do you see the role of AI evolving in the context of your work, particularly in terms of assisting with style and structure checks to reduce the subjectivity involved?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. I'm fine with that. I mean, I think I used to be used to Grammarly. I'm an academic, um, humanities based, and, you know, I have a and a doctorate in philosophy. So I just like to think of myself and that I'm pretty careful with my writing. Of course, that's not the case because writing's a multidimensional task for humans. We have to think about content and grammars at different times. Some of it's automatic. Sometimes we miss it because writing is a process of thinking things. You might change the sentence of a sentence mid thought because, um, so I'm fine with AI being aware of different, um, kinds of styles and being able to shift between them. So if the prompt says something like, edit this doc document for MLA style, not edit this doc style, great. Um, it might put some proofreaders, then proofreaders might be able to focus more on substantive content and logical consistency, things with which AI are isn't necessarily good at. You know, from my experience, AI just lacks in the ability to discuss the tail, to see the interrelation between conceptual details and details, and it tends to be very poor with context. Um, it's getting better obviously depending on the on the datasets it's trained on. But fine if AI can focus on style and formatting things that are of a technical nature in terms of the writing process. Um, my only worry about that is that, um, it might make humans a little bit lazy when it comes to being able to form those kinds of thoughts and relations. And, of course, the the knock on thought, which I can only speak to anecdotally, is that it might change the way in which our brain processes information so that we become more reliant on AI to do these kinds of things. Whereas, um, um, I think it's important that humans are well rounded in in terms of both, um, technical expertise and practicing that as well as being able to do the other theoretical things as well. And the analogy I would give probably has to do something with, um, uh, you know, you can't write poetry just thinking about, uh, the great ideas or whatever the the sort of flourishing content. You have to be able to practice, and you have to see with grammar, syntax, and knowing how those things work.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your perspective on the evolving role of AI in writing and the balance between technical assistance and human skill development is quite insightful. Given your experience with both qualitative research and technical writing, how do you approach the integration of complex technical concepts into more accessible, non-technical content, and can you provide an example of how you've successfully achieved this in your work?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Outside my work as, um, a RLHF contractor, I am a, um, research I'm a well, before I was when when cryptocurrency was doing quite well, I was head of research and a technical writer for an outfit called 1.2 Labs, which was, which is it still exists, but it's sort of in dormancy, um, which it was out, uh, the cryptocurrency research branch of a cryptocurrency. What's it called? Uh, not venture capital, but, um, hedge fund. And, uh, before the the collapse of FTX, uh, we had quite a few projects lined up, and I'd worked on 2 already as a technical writer and both completely outside my remit. But the the person hired me who's who's colleague of mine, an academic colleague of mine, um, said, you know, you don't have to know anything about cryptocurrency, but given your skill sets, that that'll be good because the way you work is that when you don't know something, you research it from the inside out. And then what's great about that is you don't assume any kind of understanding in the reader. So So in other words, when you write something, you're writing it in a way that you're explaining it to the beginner who is yourself. So that's actually a virtue of coming to something that's new as long as it's not totally outside my ability to understand. So with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, I was able to do that on the first project. And on the second project, it dealt with blockchain technology and the distribution of AI compute power across a distributed network. So that was totally new to me, but I was able to do the research based upon the client's extensive notes. Um, the the notes were designed by their research team. I I worked with the head of research in getting the document to a white and light paper. And so, basically, what I would do is I would just look at things very carefully, slowly, and minutely and see how well concepts are explained and if a beginner can understand it. So the the balance is, can a beginner understand it, and is it technically correct, and is it enticing in terms of a marketing document? So those three things. The 4th one, cryptocurrency is is it legal in terms of SEC and EU law? So in other words, is this not a security? So those are the 4 things I had to balance in this particular project. And it was it was difficult, um, that to meet with different teams from the client on on a regular basis and work with the head of research. It was actually very nice, 2 PhDs, wonderful to work with, extremely smart. Uh, and by the end of the exercise, uh, by the end of our contract, he thought my work was stellar. And, um, I thought, great. Great foundation to build on. Then we're gonna get some of the clients. I'm gonna write some great technical pay papers and light papers, and then FTX crashed. And then all the projects we had lined up said, oh, no money. Um, so, uh, that's the way I work with technical com, uh, content is I just get from the inside out and always bear in mind who am I explaining to while I'm explaining to myself as a beginner. And I love creating that kind of tight, coherent, and compelling document, which touches on technical expertise and consistency as well as accessibility to a general user and as well as billing in terms of a product. It's trying to, uh, uh, that's trying to sell a value proposition to an investor or to a potential customer.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach to breaking down complex technical concepts for a beginner audience while ensuring technical accuracy and market appeal is quite impressive. How do you see the role of AI in the future of technical writing, particularly in terms of automating the research and initial draft stages, and what aspects of the writing process do you think will remain distinctly human?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. It's a interesting dilemma. On the research side, AI has improved. There's just a lot of times where you'll enter a research question and give it to a chatbot and get the right answer. But, um, there are a couple of problems. 1, it'll often get the wrong answer, and it and I've worked with chatbots that have just been terrible with simple computation problems. And these are tend to be the free versions or the prototype versions we get, um, you know, working as a RLHF contractor trainer. Um, so the issue is that that that that has increased with accuracy. And then the other thing, which I know some chatbots do, is they have to source their material because otherwise, humans it'll be very difficult for humans to corroborate, uh, the the answer. And if it's difficult to do that, unfortunately, humans just won't bother with it, especially students. They're not gonna bother to do the the second layer of research to figure out whether or not the AI is correct. So, uh, the integration of the research with the AI response has to include links to the research. And in that way, it could be a research tool. Um, bit of a cheat from my perspective, but I understand with technology, that's how it goes. But then the other end of that is just because it's providing the correct research doesn't mean it's providing the comprehension. And the comprehension's on the human side. It's not on the AI side because AI can't comprehend or understand anything. So the the task of human writing is to be able to take that tech bridge and integrate it in a way for the person writing. They have to understand it. There's no better way to understand it than to articulate the research, incorporate the research as an articulated product through thought and through speech. 2nd side, of course, is for the understanding of, does it make sense to the reader? Uh, so I I think on the side of on the side of the relation between AI and humans, because it's gonna come down to AI is gonna provide a lot of the bulk of the the heavy lifting in terms of research. But in terms of the ability to make it communicable, detailed, and understanding in a way that meets specific human needs is something that probably only I can understand. Now what AI tends to do very well that humans don't do well is the general summary. So, um, you may ask me a question about what I think about something, but you as an AI are gonna say, that's great. You're gonna get me of what I said. That's probably gonna be better than how I put it. And that's because humans, as they think, uh, as I speak, are in a process of thinking. So he so AI is very good at taking all that content and summarizing it into bullet points and so forth or taking a 500, uh, word paragraph and summarizing it in 10 words or something like that. Um, humans tend not to be very good with that except at the second level where they have different artifacts that summarize, and they can they can make a comparison and judgment about what's better. Of course, we do that as r RLHF trainers, and that goes back into your dataset. So I think it's gonna be kind of I think the the the most the best case scenario is it's a, uh, it's a virtuous relationship where humans are using AI as part of integrated research, and AI is not doing the writing. As it stands now, it's very easy, at least from my perspective, when dealing with my own subject matter to tell when AI has written a document about philosophy or about English literature. It just doesn't have the depth or understanding.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us! The time allotted for our interview has come to an end.

Usually, it's a theme. From there, you move on to, coming up with some characters. And you place those characters in a world. And with World of Warcraft, you had a world that already existed, so you could start with using all of the Warcraft races, characters and, sides and factions, to help create the whole process. And then once you sort of have these characters working, you can come then sort of come up with the, the mission of the show and then you create your pitch deck and you pitch it.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a comprehensive overview. When it comes to character development, how do you ensure that the characters are not only compelling but also fit within the established lore of a franchise like World of Warcraft?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: You work with people who are very aware of the, and familiar with the, the brand that you're working with. Also, you do a lot of research, and, whether that's reading or watching things, to become familiar with the the brand itself. And then also you create characters that feel like real people. Just because they're an orc doesn't mean that they don't have thoughts and feelings. And then you give them all a want, which is sort of the biggest thing in writing in characters. Is, giving them something to sort of go after and then an obstacle in front of them.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Given the importance of maintaining a character's depth and motivation, how do you approach the writing process to ensure that these wants and obstacles are not only clear to the audience but also evolve over the course of a series?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, that is where planning comes in. That's where, it's called, you sort of think that the outline is for an individual script, but you also sort of build what you call the arc of the series. And in that, it's sort of you look at the series as a whole and kind of plot out your character wands over the course of the series. And then when you're working on individual episodes, you make sure that you address that so you're sort of moving the character across the, game board. For lack of a better term, to get to the end result at the end of the season.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you have a strong grasp of both character development and series planning.

So when you're working with a brand that's established, it can be difficult because, again, they have sort of these, deep roots, that have, been out there, and your audience In a lot of shows, you don't have to worry about what the audience will think because you're telling them who these characters are. But with something with an established brand, they already know who these characters are. And then you also have this, vast canon, of established rules, of established history, and so that can be really difficult, to address. And so for me, I broke down all of these issues into smaller pieces. So I didn't feel like I had to tackle everything as a whole. I always had sort of smaller, goals and aims that I would hit for each character. And then I would also reach out to, people who worked there to make sure that I was still sort of aligning with, the brand voice. And the longer that I worked on it, the easier it was where I knew I was hitting the brand voice.

I think of it as sort of I always refer to it as the beating heart. Plot is important, but your characters and who they are. People don't relate to plot They relate to people. And so all of my work is very care forward. Even if you can't relate to what's happening, you can always to who's on the screen. And even if that character is an orc or a squirrel, or, you know, a 72 year old alien or the sun. There's always something in it that's relatable and So\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given your focus on character-driven narratives, how do you approach the initial stages of a new script to ensure that the characters are not only relatable but also capable of carrying the story forward in a compelling way?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: that always goes back to the idea of outlining, making sure that your characters are sort of, pushing things forward. And for that, you really want active characters. You want characters who are not reacting to things, but are taking charge and making choices. And the reality is you also need to make sure sometimes those choices are incorrect because that's what makes it interesting and that's what makes it compelling is having those characters mess up a lot.

Are you trying to sell a story? Are you trying to sell a product? Are you trying to evoke a feeling? There's a lot of different, aims for content when you're producing that online. And, so that's sort of how I approach that. I forget what the second part of the of the question was.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: The second part was about the role of audience analysis in your content development process. How do you ensure that the content you're developing resonates with the intended audience, and do you have any specific strategies for gathering and incorporating audience feedback during the development phase?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, it's really tough. Generally, you don't have audience feedback during the development phase because you can sort of it's death by a 1000 paper cuts. Because not everybody is going to like everything. You can't have focus groups, but, it the really the key is sort of knowing your audience beforehand. And, making sure this is where things like theme and character play a great role. If you're writing for kids, making sure that like, the issues that are facing your characters are relatable to kids. The reality is your audience is going to have some some sort of through time with some some different outlooks in the sense of the technology will change and the language will change, but the feelings don't change. And so if you make sure to sort of adhere to those themes and your characters having these relatable moments, your audience will come along.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Given the challenges of incorporating audience feedback during development, how do you personally validate whether the content you've developed is resonating with the intended audience, especially for a project with a significant lead time before release?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Again, it goes back to this idea of of themes. There are sort of only so many themes out there. And, you know, a kid feeling left out or, you know, a bad breakup, it doesn't matter if you're in the year 2048 or you're in 1790 2. The feelings of those are always going to resonate with your audience. The other thing is, you know, sometimes there are new challenges that audiences face. And so a lot of that is research. A lot of that is going online, going to where your audience will be hanging out, whether that's looking at Reddit or looking at TikTok or you know, finding these sort of niche niche places, and sort of listening to how they talk, listening or watching, sort of what they watch, know, your audience may have, like, specific, shows that they enjoy. So, like, watch those shows and try to figure out, like, oh, what is it that they're relating to this? And I think what a lot of places get wrong is they get hung up on the stuff versus the feeling because the audience wants to feel something. That's why they always come back.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your focus on the universality of themes and the importance of understanding how and where your audience engages is insightful. Shifting back to your screenwriting skill, could you discuss a specific technique or tool you use to ensure that the pacing of your scripts is engaging and effective, especially in terms of balancing character development with plot progression?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Oh, sure. I think that a lot of that comes in the in the outline process, which is part of screenwriting even though it's not, like, technically sitting down and writing your screenplay. And, one of the things that I do personally is, once I'm sort of done crafting my outline is that I read it out loud. And reading it out loud, you can sort of tell where the lows hit. And when you're reading something, it's forcing you to engage with it. And so if you find that you're getting bored with it, then it's you know that it's boring and it needs more or the pace needs to pick up or there's there's a there's a point missing. So that's a technique that is super useful in making sure that, your pace, and timing and action is working But, honestly, over sort of the the course of my career, I've been doing this long enough where I can just I just know because it's my experience.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Reading the outline aloud is a great practical tip for assessing pacing. Given your experience, how do you handle situations where there's a difference of opinion on the pacing or structure of a script, particularly in a collaborative environment, and what strategies do you use to resolve such conflicts while maintaining the integrity of your vision for the project?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, it depends who's in charge. Usually, on every project, especially in television, there is one person in the writer's room who it's their vision. So if I am working for them, I may push my idea but I also will respect, I'll respect the boss unless I think it is something that is, actively harmful, and then I will stand my ground. If I am the boss, I will listen to feedback. I will even well, sometimes, it's called sort of pitching out. We'll pitch it out to sort of see where it ends up. And see, like, oh, maybe that is actually a a a better choice, but we need to sort of follow the story down the road a little bit. If the entire writer's room is agreeing, but, the brand or the, network is disagreeing, Sometimes, you know, we'll stand our ground. Sometimes, we'll we'll compromise. I usually I try to make everyone feel heard, because I think that's important. And, obviously, if they're bringing something up, there's a reason for it. But if I am the person in charge, I am also interested in always the best idea because if it's my name on it, then I get credit for it. But, but sometimes sort of the the I'll I'll let them pitch it out and follow their ideas down the road. And, generally, we can see then whether it's the better idea or not. So, again, willing to compromise because I'm only one brain, but also my level, of experience and knowledge is usually greater than lot of other people.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to handling differences in a collaborative environment is very diplomatic and strategic. Now, let's dive into a more technical aspect of screenwriting. Could you explain how you use the three-act structure in your screenplays, and do you have any specific techniques for ensuring that each act serves its purpose effectively?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. Outline. Outline. Outline. You'll you'll know in the outline. That's why some people just will start writing, but your outline will tell you exactly, like, where you need to go. That's your road map. That's your skeleton, that you hang, your your tree your Christmas tree that you hang all of the ornaments on. So that that will sort of give you everything that you need to to go and do. Also, sometimes, breaking each act out and just, like, looking at one act at a time, can also, like, oh, is this enjoyable? Does this feel whole? Does this feel like there is a, a cliffhanger? There are certain screenwriting, tools. Some people use something called save the cat. I don't like to totally use it, but there are places where I think it's super useful, especially, when you talk about that, you know, act 2 dark knight at the soul, making sure that you kind of, hit those marks. Because what happens is that people sometimes, they just don't have anything kind of happen, and then it all happens at the end. And you wanna make sure that your your, your action is sort of plotted out, but that it still slowly grows over time. And that is, again, like, partially outlined and then, you know, looking at those active breaks to make sure that, it's getting to where you need to go. Also, I find that if you are having a problem with act 3, that means that you have a problem with act 1 because act 1 is sort of asking a question and act 3 should answer it. So if you can't answer it, chances are you probably weren't asking the correct question in act 1.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your emphasis on the importance of outlining and using the three-act structure as a guide is a solid approach. Given the complexity of the projects you've worked on, how do you manage the interplay between the overarching series plot and the individual episode plots to ensure a satisfying balance of closure and continuity for the audience?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That's a combo pack of you want to do something called it's called breaking the season. Which is essentially, I actually personally apply the 3 action structure of the outline to an entire season of episodes. So if I have a a 13 episode order, the first 3 episodes will be act 1, the last 3 will be act 2, and the 7 in the middle will be I'm sorry. The first 3 will be act 1. The last 3 will be act 3, and the 7 in the middle will be act 2. And then I sort of plot all of my, my characters need to be up here? Do they need to be down here? And then I sort of individually assign out kind of the plot, and the character wants and needs and obstacles in each episode. And then we individually outline those episodes. If I am working alone like I did on novel more, that's easier because it's all in my head and I've done it all. If I'm working with a writing staff then it's I sit down with the writers. I talk about sort of the issue. We may work on the outline together or I may give them the outline. And then, when they bring it back, I'll give appropriate notes And then there's probably a certain point where I will just go in and, do a do a quick polish ideally just to make sure that it's it's where it needs to be. And because I'm the boss, that's usually a pretty quick process. Again, because I've been doing it for a long time, and I'm the one ultimately responsible for the entire voice of the show.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach to structuring a season as a three-act narrative is a unique and effective way to maintain a cohesive story arc. Given the dynamic nature of the entertainment industry, how do you stay updated with the latest trends and audience preferences to ensure that your content remains relevant and engaging?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Oh, that's a good one. I don't I mean, I do. The problem is that whatever the audience is watching currently, it's gonna change in a year to 2 years. But whatever I'm working on now won't come out for a year to 2 years. So trying to chase what the audience is currently doing is not helpful. You do wanna sort of be forward thinking, this is where it helps to really know who your audience is Are you writing for kids? Are you writing for bridge? Are you writing for tweens? And then looking at kind of the emotional issues that your audience faces, and then writing towards that. Because the thing is once you're project, once your series is ready to be pitched, or once your screenplay is done, you can kinda go back and put in the kind of, things that will make it more current. But, you can't chase and what the audience is looking for right this very minute. Because, again, by the time your stuff comes out, it'll feel old. Because it will be 2 years out of date because that's, you know, the minimum it takes. To, get something from idea or script stage to out there. The audience to see.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your perspective on staying true to the core emotional issues that resonate with your target audience, rather than chasing current trends, is a valuable insight. Now, let's shift our focus back to your screenwriting skill. Could you discuss a specific technique or tool you use to ensure that the dialogue in your scripts is both natural and serves the story effectively?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Sure. I've listened to a lot of people talk. That's super useful. Everywhere I go, I'm doing research And, you can sometimes you know, if you're worried about slang, just being online and sort of, like, against seeing where your target audience is hanging out and then, like, listening to them, or seeing what their talking about. But, again, that sort of falls out of favor pretty quickly, so I don't like to rely on that. The other thing to make dialogues sound natural is you read it out loud. And reading your, your screenplay out loud, even if you're doing all the parts, or sometimes you can, like, host a what's called a table read and have your your friends read it, really gives you the sense of what it sounds like, and does it sound like people talk.

We regularly bagged up data from Redis to a more persistent storage solution, such as relational database or distributed file system. This ensured that even if Redis has been data loss or failure, we could recover the data from the backup. Snap sorting and persistent. Also, the display option for snapshotting where it periodically write the dataset to disk and persistent, where it continuously logs changes to disk.

Also, we apply indexing to optimize search performance, especially for live dataset. For user profile, we index relevant fields such as username, skill set, and rating. And similarly, for context, we index field like contact name, tags, start, end date. And so indexing helps speed up search query by allowing the database to quickly locate relevant world. Feeding full text search. We implemented full text search capability using tools like Elasticsearch. Datoot allow for advanced search functionality, such as Fuzzy marking, synonym marking, and element encoding. Also, to analyze data set effectively, we implemented pagination to limit the number of search details returned per page. This not only improved performance by reducing the amount of data offered over the network, but also enhanced the user experience by presenting search data in manageable chunks. Also, for computationally intensive search operation outside that requires querying multiple data source, we implemented asynchronous processing. This involved offloading search tag to background work across separate microservice to prevent blocking the main application thread and improving risk.

In late quality projector, we ensured efficient and responsive site functionality by carefully managing the coordination and monitoring the background workers or to create Microsoft for asynchronous processing. Here is how we handle it. Start queue. We'll start to search as, uh, ready to sign the message broker to manage a synchronous task. Whenever search request was received, we added it to the task queue where background worker on microservices picked it up for processing. We also implemented load balancing to distribute search request evenly across multiple background virtual or microservices. This prevented any single worker from becoming overwhelmed with the high volume of search request. We also reconfigure our infrastructure to automatically scale up or scale down the number of background workers or microservices on the workload. This dynamic scaling allowed us to handle fluctuation inside traffic efficiently while optimizing resource, utilization, and call. We also implemented comprehensive monitoring and logging solution to track the performance and health of background workers and Microsoft services. This include metrics such as response time, error rate, and resource utilization. We set up alerting mechanism to notify us of any performance degradation or failures in the background because of microservices.

Also viewed abstracts and which had implementation details and provide a clear interface for interacting with object. We use method and property to extract our complex logic and provide a simple interface for other parts of the code to interact with. Also, inheritance, although JavaScript doesn't support classifying inheritance like some other language, we can still achieve inheritance to prototype training or object completion. JavaScript also support 1 morphism to dynamic typing and dark typing. Object can achieve a different behavior based on their type for the method they implemented. Also, we favored competition over other in items to promote code view and maintain maintainability, With based on complex, we have it into smaller, more manageable component and composed object by combining these smaller component. Also, we design patterns such as factory, singleton, object and modular pattern. These patterns provide open solution to common problems in OOP and can be effectively applied in JavaScript.

So specifically with Zotero, using it as, like, a a a tracker of a lot of my sources for different citations, things like that. It was the beginning, the biggest challenge was just learning how to use the software and then implementing it correctly within my research category or a collection of sources that I could input into whatever work product I was creating.

Absolutely. So one of the key functions that I have in this position is, reviewing different regulations that are kind of put out by the California Public Utilities Commission.

What we do is kind of think about how this is gonna affect small businesses within primarily California, but more specifically within San Francisco area. In the Bay Area. And, one of the primary key results that I've been able to see through my work is, California is implementing a new, kind of regulatory rule making authority where they're looking for public comment and feedback, and I'm working on that and using the tertiary secondary sources, I've been able to, draft recommendations of how small business utility advocates should comment to the administrative law judge to make sure our clients, small businesses within the Bay Area, are adequately represented. And in doing so, they've been able to incorporate some of that feedback into the draft rule making.

I can. So one of the primary ways that I think about collecting and collating large amounts of information resources is you know, tracking that information, making sure I know my question, making sure I know my project, and then kinda annotating when I need to different avenues for collecting that information. So making sure I know within these 6 different rule making authorities or within these 6 different procedures, I can quickly kind of format, understand, annotate, I have an idea of where that information is, and then I'm able to kind of incorporate that within whatever writing component I might have. For example, I'm drafting a memo, I have all my sources within the document. I have my central questions, and then I can kind of start from a more broader point of view. And then as I write kind of narrow the question and within scope. So I've been able to do that through legal memos. Through my comments publication, through when I was a contract drafting attorney within the transactional world, a lot of that was germane going through different contracts to incorporate the necessary language within that contract. It was a key component of what I did, and how I was able to create legal effective work, and that was you know, making sure I had my sources, understanding the broader questions and themes. And then as I write, become more specific, using those sources and the question that I had in mind to answer for a client.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to managing and utilizing sources for different legal contexts is quite thorough.

Could you explain a complex feature or function within Microsoft Office Suite that you've utilized in a professional setting, and the specific benefits it provided in that context?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So within Word, understanding the macro programs. So the formatting features, the functions, being able to use word on a high level is more than just being able to write text within the document. It's it's understanding how to quickly and efficient be organized documents, to make it appear nicer and more organized. And that goes from formatting 80 page papers using citations, all the robust functions within Word. But this also extends to PowerPoint, for example, understanding a lot of the macro features in PowerPoint to create a adequate presentation where it's organized You have your notes. You have the presentation. It's not too cluttered or clogged. And while I have good working knowledge of Excel, well, it is not close to the what I think the powers and capabilities are of itself, but I'm much more proficient within PowerPoint and within Word.

It's part and parcel to it. I see them kind of blending together and enhancing as a lawyer. As an attorney, the powers and functions and capabilities of my legal research. So it shouldn't be something that's shunned or something that shouldn't be used. It should be used to augment the capabilities of an attorney. So I think within the form of legal research, there's boundless capacity for it to be kind of incorporated, and I kinda wanna be on the edge of that because I think it's super important. For example, you know, if I'm researching, a case law, I can do a lot of my case law reading and review. However, that, you know, that's time consuming if I am able to use AI to more accurately track the cases that I need to use for regulatory compliance within a specific circuit within a specific district that's great. But if I'm able to draw more cases, with using AI, that's even better, and I think it'll help strengthen attorneys' legal research and writing capabilities.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given your perspective on the integration of AI in legal research, how do you think the current tools like LexisNexis and Westlaw could be enhanced with AI to provide even more value to legal professionals, and what specific features would you like to see in such an enhanced tool?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: I think it can be more accurate in the sense of instead of giving you so many cases, they can give you less cases, more specific to the functions of what's happening. For example, if I type in energy regulation, within the Northern District of California, it'll pull up many different cases, some that are not germane But if you can classify the cases further, you know, if I'm looking for something within, electrical compliance instead of pulling up cases just related to energy compliance. They can pull up cases that are associated with electrical compliance and EV charging. Or it can pull up cases that, are tangentially related to that. So I think the biggest thing in AI is ensuring the accuracy and train of thought versus accuracy within word recognition, whereas the word electric or energy and it pulls up that case as opposed to understanding a deeper idea of what the case is about to incorporate that into the research algorithm would be super important.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your insights into the potential for AI to improve the specificity and relevance of search results in legal research are quite valuable.

Absolutely. One of the most significant challenges is just ensuring that you've reviewed all of the relevant paperwork, documents, understanding if there's any title commitments or title issues within a merger and an acquisition. When you're, you know, working on an m and a case, for example, making sure there's not a section where within one of previous contracts that they have to get approval, and and it's just a lot of it's understanding the the meta analysis and kind of the the meta ideas and previous iterations of contracts, not just the current version you're working for. So for example, if you're working for a current entity, and that current entity was owned by 3 others understanding those contracts and the provisions that are still operable into the current contract and understanding who you need to get approval from, understanding the different contract components that kind of inhibit certain entity requirements if there's a voter shareholder or there's, different terms or ideas that are used the previous iterations of contracts, making sure they follow the same streamline of thought. Also, an an m and a is just working with, opposing counsel and understanding that you don't want to inhibit a relationship, but you also wanna represent the clients in the best of your ability. Understanding what to give up and what to give opposing counsel. In terms of drafting an adequate contract that, you know, makes both parties happy. So I'd say the 2 biggest challenges are understanding the previous contract iterations when you're doing due diligence to make sure you're crossing your t's and dotting your i's, making sure a lot of the work is, you know, legal germane and also adhering to previous contracts. So it's not opening up the client to any liability, but also working with your current client to make sure that they are not you know, giving too much of it in their interest.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your explanation of the challenges in due diligence for Mergers and Acquisitions is quite detailed.

Certainly. So one of the most important things within contract drafting is just ensuring brevity and conciseness. And know, there's accuracy within precision. So a lot of contract draft strategy that I use is taking a template contract, understanding what The main point of contention and the goal is ensuring that you're writing using specific words within shorter sentences that convey that thought and idea. There's no need for an 80 page contract as something could be done in 10. Understanding that all the key provisions are in there, and they're adequately addressed to the point. So I think the best contract drafting strategy is to be sure, precise with brevity. So that is one of the primary things within my contract drafting strategies.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your focus on brevity and precision in contract drafting is a valuable approach. Now, considering your experience with regulatory procedures, how do you stay updated on the changes in regulations, and could you describe a specific tool or method you use to ensure you're aware of these changes in a timely manner?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. It's a lot. It's through AI AI systems that send me news blast letters. I keep updated through LexisNexis through Westlaw. And within regulatory compliance where it's sending me different issues, day to day ideas, and changes within case law. And that's the primary tool I use, but also through the work that I do, a lot of it is updated daily. So I'm reading new rule making ideas. New public comments, kind of ideas like that. So I would say the way I say updated is through adequate information that's through news blast, through my work, just kind of ensuring that I'm I'm staying up to date with the regulations that are coming through. And the regulatory compliance ideas that are coming through through newsletters and through my work.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that you have a comprehensive approach to staying updated on regulatory changes. Shifting back to your experience with legal research, how do you evaluate the credibility of sources, especially in emerging areas of law, and could you provide an example of a strategy you've used to ensure the reliability of such sources?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. So ensuring the credibility of sources can come through. Several different ways. One of the primary ways that I look at is it's through you know, if we're looking at sources through primary means, ensuring that this study was conducted adequately, ensuring that it's being used in the appropriate manner. It doesn't wanna be know, kind of some nebulous idea, but is it actually stating an idea in our opinion? Then kinda taking a step back from that, has this source been used in other components? Like, if it's being used in legal cases, if it's an expert witness, then it's gonna attach more credibility to that idea. But even diving more into the background of that idea, I think, is important. In establishing the credibility of a source. But if it's just kind of more of a writing source, you gotta be careful with it. You gotta under you know, you gotta trust that if it's coming through a newspaper article, you gotta research the idea, the the journalist making sure that it's intellectually sound. So you know, if it's used in the legal context, it gives you more leeway as opposed to something that you just find on the Internet that's the source. So in assessing credibility, you gotta be you gotta be discriminatory in the way that you use it, understanding the ins and outs, the intellectual ideas, and going back to the root of it to really make sure it's credible at the end of the day.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to evaluating the credibility of sources, especially in the legal context, is quite thorough.

So going back to making sure you understand the idea of you gotta understand the broader idea of what you're drafting in the persuasive brief. For example, I used some draft expert testimony for water rights in Louisiana, and I would talk with the scientific experts that were way above my expertise, but I had to incorporate you know, our legal positioning with their super dense scientific terms and ideologies. So it's making sure I understand understand what our key position is. Understanding what they're saying, understanding the nexus between what they're saying and that correlates to our position, stripping away the extraneous information that they provide, to help narrowly focus in within our legal goals and that's kind of the best way to do it. It's to understand the idea of what we have, you know, the broad issue, the idea, the specific component of what we need, and finding the information within an expert witness that scientific and kinda tying that into our very specific legal goal.

For the first question, I found that the most difficult portion of that project was needing to be able to actually get alignment from a bunch of different teams. So there was the development team that was handling the front end. So we were working on AEM. In that regard. The back end team that was actually working with the commerce system, which was Magento at the time, There was a concurrent services implementation, so there was so for service cloud that was being implemented as well as a microservice team that was working with kind of microservices that needed to be built up, and MuleSoft was handling the integration between all of those different systems, and that was in the middle of of a transition as well. So for my role, it was required that I had quite a bit of input in terms of being able to make sure that all of those teams were aligned in terms of features that needed to be built. So I was quite client facing in that regard. But then making sure that all of the requirements and all of the build was was working concurrently because all of the teams effectively had to move in lockstep. Regarding the second question, with the Team for the connector company. That one was difficult because it actually was a project that started in the February of 2020 before COVID hit. Then it lit up. Being scoped to, to do the same delivery over the same period of time. During the March of 2020 lockdowns. That was a bit difficult because, again, it was a global rollout. So we had our initial meetings where the team from Europe was actually there on Thursday, then by Friday, they all had to fly back. So we had to finish up our our kickoff without the European team. The Asian team was was not allowed to travel at all because of some of the mandates, and so we ended up being completely remote. And just being able to ask questions as quickly as we had initially as we had initially thought ended up being a little bit more difficult. With that one, it was a Commerce Cloud integration. MuleSoft as well as as well as or implementation rather, as well as Services Cloud. And because it was a company that had a lot of international clients, they had quite a bit of Quite a few mandates that we needed to keep up with on an international basis. Things like conflict minerals or or hazardous materials, So the number of case types that they were using was was quite large. As far as what we actually needed to account for. And so the workflows of all those different case types ended up adding to the complexity of that role. I believe the third question was related to my research experience when I was looking at companies in the APAC region. So a big part about this, what I noticed when it came time to speaking to startups was actually having a chance to Speak directly to the individuals that were on the ground. Given that our VP is a growth stage firm, a big part of what we actually were doing, we're trying to identify who the earlier stage firms were in the area. That would have a better visibility and kind of the ability to play closer to the net Then we would. Given that companies had to hit specific metrics before they became of interest, but being able to build those relationships from the beginning was huge. So I spent quite a bit of time on LinkedIn. I was doing a lot of cold prospecting I started relatively close. So the firms that I had had an opportunity to work with, I would go and speak to those individuals and ask if they knew investors that were in the area. So through those types of those types of introductions, I was then able to get quite a bit of a build up quite a bit of a network for individuals who are in that space So that the cold emailing combined with kind of expanding the current network allowed me to get a decent amount of input from both founders and investors that were in the space and actually still keep in touch with a few of them today. So that's been a really helpful growth experience. The next question asked about the the Capital IQ pitch book, and pitch book, tools and affinity that I've used. So I've actually found helpful. I use it the most frequently. And that's actually been really helpful for all types of of different experiences. I think one of the biggest ones was when I was actually in school. I used quite a bit because it allowed me to go and identify individuals and find out how to get in contact with them. A big part of what I was doing when I was there, I was the president of our entrepreneurship and venture capital club, so I needed to be able to source speakers. And being able identify people's names and then get their email addresses based off of Facebook information was really helpful. With Capital IQ, I found that it was actually the most helpful when I needed to do diligence for comps in terms of what I would be able to use as far as best case scenarios. If you will, for for outcomes. So being able to get the the data from public companies as far as what rounds were they trading at, what were the multiples as far as what the revenue to, valuation multiple would be at each respective realm so we could get a little bit of visibility into what it would look like all the way up until an IPO for a for an early stage company that we're looking at. Just kinda compare that to what the the current outcome was with with a company that had already kind of seen that success within a similar sector. In the same space. I believe those were all the questions. \n""], [""Interviewer: Thank you for the detailed responses. Let's dive into a case study scenario relevant to your experience. Imagine you are tasked with leading a project to integrate an e-commerce platform with a CRM system for a global electronics manufacturer. The systems involved include Salesforce Commerce Cloud, MuleSoft for integration, and a customer data platform. How would you approach designing the solution architecture for this integration? What potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in executing this project successfully?\n"", ""Interviewee: So as far as the design is concerned, I've never actually been on this solution architecture side. Most of what I under or most of what I worked with rather was really understanding the way that the business worked and then seeing how the system would effectively be able to extend to handle what they, what they were already working with and what the to b process could be like. Given what was just described, the MuleSoft team integration team would actually have to be involved in every single aspect. Given that MuleSoft is native to Salesforce. That is a little bit more helpful, but the fact that there's a Commerce Cloud portion as well as a customer data management system, there would be some need to make sure there would be a need rather to make sure that the data mapping is is really critical. So from the commerce perspective, I think that let's start with understanding exactly the the end state needs to look like, what the customer's experience actually needs to be within that commerce section. I think there's a difference between b to c commerce and b to b commerce. Far as what that experience typically looks like or has looked like in terms of the the projects that I've been a part of. And so making sure that that is very clear and making sure that the business is is involved in that from the beginning, I think, would be paramount. To that point, I would also make sure that the integration team is along for the ride. Because I found that what actually usually happens is when the integration team doesn't have good visibility into what the end process needs to actually look like, not only can they not suggest the best way to go about handling the integrations They actually need to be taught kind of a second time. Basically, what all the systems would be doing because they sit in the middle and they wouldn't have access to to the endpoints in terms of the beginning and the end. As far as the data management system, That would be more or less static in terms of the way that it has already been built. And so I would say that just a very, very good base level of understanding is, is the way that that needs to go. I think that in terms of actually getting the team together, there needs to be a champion from that side because typically, I found that those types of systems are run by 1 or 2 individuals who just have all of the information. And, being able to being able to proceed without them isn't really something that I've seen done successfully. So making sure that they are involved from the beginning all the way through the entire process would be paramount. And that that's more or less how we design it. In terms of challenges, I think the schedules would line up. I think what I've laid out are quite a few dependencies you know, the MuleSoft team or the integration team needing to get a lot of visibility from both the business side business side needing to understand where exactly that data is coming from, what form it's coming from to make sure that the mapping takes place, and then being able to explain that experience well And with these dependencies, what ends up happening is iteration actually ends up moving a little bit more slowly from what I've experienced. So if the experience for the customer the end customer, is not very, very clearly laid out or understood, in the beginning, which tends to be the case with some of the clients that I've had. Then a big portion of what we actually spent our time on was really iterating and trying to make changes on the fly. As far as challenges, this one is not necessarily one that The integration team would be dealing with, but I've had a bit of experience with this one as well where the way that the project is sold, the commercial side then begins to have implications as far as how the actual work is being done. So say for instance, it's something like a fixed bid versus the time of materials, if the amount of money that has already been spent on the project is more or less fixed and things like chain orders have to come into play, it really just messes with the speed of of execution and delivery there, and, and then it starts to get a little bit contentious because each side has their own their own things that they're trying to to vie for. So the incentives get a little bit misaligned. So I feel like that would be of the challenges is to make sure that it sound both on the dependency side, but also on the commercial side of the project. \n""], ['Interviewer: Great insights on the solution architecture and challenges. What would be the key steps or milestones in implementing this integration project from start to finish? How would you prioritize these steps to ensure a smooth execution?\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So as far as key steps, I would say the initial phases where it's actually being sold are huge because it needs to be scoped correctly. Being able to understand what personnel is actually required as far as what the timelines would look like and what the actual work that needs to be completed Would be excuse me, Would be paramount. So that would say I would say that would definitely be the first phase Once all of that has been decided and there's a good method of working that has actually been established, The next step, I think, would then be kind of the blueprinting. So really getting somebody who has a good functional and business skills to partner with someone who has very sound technical skills on the implementation team. To go in and take a look at what already exists there. This was a big part of what I used to have to do where I would go in and really just get a good understanding of how the business actually functioned, kind of in the as is. So the 2 b section and the 2 b way that things would be handled you could take a little bit of time as you're figuring it out, but really, really sound understanding of what all actually exists within the current day process and what all the actual workers within the company are doing is is really, really required. So I would say that that blueprint phase that needs to be kind of accounted for needs to be thought of really well and really soundly. The reason why is because now you want to start to establish some level of expertise on your own team. So there needs to be an individual who has a good enough understanding of the business where there will still be questions. They can build up rapport with the customer and all of that. But big portion of their job now is to effectively act as the quote unquote wealth of knowledge within that implementation team. So for questions that exist, they would be coming to somebody who's in that role. They would effectively be, like, a kind of a functional lead in that capacity. And it really helps if you are coupled with somebody who has that level of technical expertise because then they can expect they can give they can set expectations rather as far as letting individuals know what is possible. \n""], ['Interviewer: In terms of potential trade-offs or compromises that may be needed during this e-commerce and CRM integration, what are some that you foresee? How would you manage these trade-offs to maintain project momentum?\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So a good example of a trade off that I've actually seen in real time is the difference between potentially having live updates versus something like batch updates. And so this would be a good example of a trade off in terms of because it will really come down to what the customer experience needs to be And Really, what product it is that you're selling that needs to kinda hinge on that customer experience. An example is for a larger b to b connector company, they could afford to do batch updates that only updated every hours. It wouldn't get in the way of their business because these are larger enterprises that are expecting these connectors and cables and electronic parts. They could afford to have their inventory updated on a daily basis And if they actually if their inventory management system wasn't 100% up to date, that would be fine because a lot of what they had at actually established were, for enterprise level contracts. And so being able to go and build to capacity wasn't an issue at all. A second example where that trade off would be would need to be a live update as far as something like inventory or being able to make sure the customer experience, they have a really, really granular view of what's actually taking place is when I was working with a firm that was doing wireless glucose monitors. That is something that is, a, it's a health care item. So individuals' lives are are hinging on it. And then, b, it's also primarily consumer facing, which is what we were seeing. And so people are a little bit more impatient than, than companies are. And naturally, we've been conditioned to be that way, so it's expect So the customer experience needs to be able to to take that into account. Things like live updates are extremely necessary, an up to date inventory management system is also extremely necessary because a customer who's expecting good, especially health care good at a certain time, doesn't necessarily have the the ability to wait And so you don't want to be in a situation where that customer's experience is now a, making them lose trust in the company, b, negatively impacting their life in a way that health care Component's good. So I would say that's an example of a trade off, something like speed. Of delivery and visibility within, order shipment statuses. Would be an example of the trade off. That potentially could happen with with a project like this. \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for outlining those trade-offs. Can you also discuss potential opportunities for future enhancements or expansions once the initial integration project is successfully implemented? What steps would you recommend taking to ensure these enhancements are future-proof?\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So this is, good question. I think a lot of what I've seen as far as expansion and and potential enhancements really relate to the way that the customer goes through the ordering process. I found that that kinda coupled with customer service, like, a really tight customer service to ordering loop has a lot of what we ended up doing that ended up actually helping quite a bit from an enhancement standpoint. So say for instance, a customer only has the ability to order via web. Still the most common way that individuals are going and handling some of these orders, especially if we're looking at the kind of b to b space, especially in electronics. And then if you're looking at health care items, that's completely fine and completely normal. However, a big part of what we were scoping for the next enhancement was the mobile integration. So being able to get people access to these goods via their phone, so it's a much more convenient ordering process That's an example of something that I think would be a huge enhancement that would allow individuals to especially kind of on the b to c side, it would allow them to more naturally indoctrinate this type of work into their, their typical workflow. I think that that's a very important enhancement both from a customer experience side but also from a system side. So in terms of what I believe would be need needed to take into account or would need to be taken to account rather, Just to make sure that this exists is something that has a mobile application building able making sure that you're building your page to be responsive Regardless of what form or what medium you're going through, Being able to handle your testing on your different on your different with your site, your application, your different modalities, I guess. Is a is a good way to put that into take that into consideration. And then making sure that your application's experience and your web experience are seamless between the two. And so if I'm somebody who goes to an application for a website that I typically approach, and go to. I don't like when one seems like it's completely, like, different from the other. I think that the experience should be a uniform one when it goes from let's say, mobile to web. And so making sure that that that's taken into account When, when the initial implementation is being done, as far as enhancements are concerned. My concern. \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your insights and experiences. Given the complexity of such integration projects, how would you ensure effective communication and collaboration across cross-functional teams globally, especially considering different time zones and potential remote work scenarios?\n', ""Interviewee: So a big portion of what we actually ended up doing we had core members of each team Colocate. On a fairly regular basis. That way, there would be an e an easy exchange of information. But we did have developers that were based all over from China to India to Belgium and then the US. There is a bit of like, a sacrifice that's required, just to make sure that everybody can at least have some working hours that are synchronous because some of those things do need to take place. But I really think it comes down to the personnel. The leader of each individual Like I mentioned, there was a front end team, there was an integration team, back end team, etcetera. For one of these projects. Those individuals, each one needs to have, like, a very, very clear understanding of what their individual group is required to to provide I think the biggest mentality shift that was required in order for us to be able to successfully deliver this was yes, getting your own work was done, but everybody's, like, active first goal needs to make sure that they are not blocking anybody else, with teams with this highest this high level of dependency given their their complexity. When a team lead was no longer working to unblock everybody else, it became very, very apparent So that ended up having cascading effects as far as slowing things down. I would say as far as communication is concerned, yes, we did have a Slack channel, and so making sure everybody is utilizing that actually is aware of the fact that they need to understand very, very very, very minutely what they are doing and how that implements or impacts the full project. But then the last part is really just making sure that the mentality is is correct as far as everybody understands that, yes, this is the But But your primary goal is to make sure that you are not blocking anybody else on the team at all times. And so if there's work that needs to be done as far as a feature build that's independent and there's work that needs to be done in terms of unblocking, unblocking needs to be be the priority, and that needs to be communicated just very, very clearly and very often to \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to interview with us!

To try and turn products into as a service type of products or subscription based products.

It's trying to turn several products into an as a service product. But after coming up with the financial models and after coming up after forming relationships with different departments like sales, marketing, finance, legal, get their buy in, convince them that it was to Rico's best advantage to try to change all of their offerings into an as a service or subscription type offerings.

And so at the time that I was hired, we were brought into a brand new team that was created, the transformational licensing agreement, where we basically transformed the entire way that Dell does business with their customers. So they were they were licensing out their top of title license and I was able to identify which of those deals were most productive and were most profitable to Dell EMC. I built the financial models and that along with the sales operations team We identified which sales made the most sense, and we did the contract in terms, the pricing, and that led to the creation of, 1,000,000 25 1,000,000 plus 25 licensing agreements that were sold.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: Interesting.

Now, let's move on to a case study style problem that aligns with your background and expertise. Imagine you are leading a team at a mid-sized tech company that wants to transition its flagship software product from a one-time purchase model to a subscription-based model. The goal is to increase recurring revenue and improve customer retention. Can you propose a high-level solution architecture or approach to tackle this transition? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: That's exactly what I did at Rico USA. So, basically, basically, we first started with a survey, and we surveyed a bunch of different customers and asked them what their opinions were for software as a service as a service products, subscription based products. And based on the results of the of the of the survey that we sent out to our customers, we were able to identify exactly how they wanted these offerings to be, how they wanted the subscription or as a service to be formulated for. So, basically, we did the financial modeling to model it out for 5 years, and then we discovered that by changing our products, into as a service offerings, then we could project 38 $1,000,000 increase in revenue because you increase annual recurring revenue with a subscription process. So, basically, after I got the buy in, we changed several products, including printers. That was the case study that we did at Sanrico. We're basically in stack. Beforehand, Rico was selling and leasing their printers and copy machines. And when I came on board, after doing the financial analysis and getting the buying throughout upper level management, I was able to, sure, let them know that it's feasible, it's profitable, and we turned copy machines into an as a service offering for mids mid midsize businesses, which made sense for them because now mid level companies can afford the machinery that they needed to create conduct their business. So that successfully was launched, and we again project an increase in our of $38,000,000 just by the methodology that I that I did was by by talking to several people, getting insights, and getting feedback from customers, not getting feedback from internal partners like finance, marketing, sales, and then building the right financial models that showed the proformas and showed annual recurring revenue how much it would increase by turning all the products into a subscription based product.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for that detailed response. What potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in transitioning the flagship software product to a subscription-based model? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Well, the challenge would be to help organizations accept the the the the product as a service as their business as usual case in the methods. And the way to do that is to show them that it's financially feasible feasible for small to medium sized businesses to be able to afford subscription because you don't have to commit to a term. You pay on a month to month basis. And with the prices right and if they're happy with the service, they continue paying for their monthly subscription as long as they've received the service and they're utilizing the services from your product. That's the way you can overcome the make sure you understand what the customer wants, make it a customer centric product. And then go forward with providing that to the market.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: What would be the key steps or milestones in implementing your proposed solution for transitioning to a subscription-based model? \n\n', 'Interviewee: Well, I would work with upper level management to set up those key steps. The key steps would be to get approval from finance to get approval from legal. To teach the sales executives the new method of selling teach them the new products that we are offering. So all these different objectives to take step by steps, different approval processes, and then just get sales to buy into it by teaching them and instructing them you know, why it be to their best advantage to sell their products to their customers on subscription based off And then we can get accounting to buy to to provide some financial projections as well on how ARR would increase. By turning into a subscription based product.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: What potential trade-offs or compromises might need to be made during the implementation of this transition? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Different pricing structures if you are going to end the the term of length when it comes to trying to figure out what is the best option for a customer.

So first of all, I have around 6 years of experience in social media, and I have worked with major international companies like Garena, Hong Kong Intertek, ByteDance, and. In my last 6 years of experience, I have worked been working extensively in social media strategy, social media campaigns, influencer marketing, and all of branding with the company. So at Homegrown Intertech, I have increased in 70% of the revenue and overall visibility of the brand. So, uh, before that, I have, uh, led a team of 20 influencer marketing strategies in India and a strategy for promoting our furniture products to Instagram. So, uh, I have, um, made the complete SOP for working Amazon campaigns as well as influencer marketing campaigns. Uh, I led the team members and helped them in reaching out to the influencers through generated text, and as well as we have used AI and JetGPT in finding out, uh, the best influencers in furniture category. As our company, we majorly work on furniture and auto parts. We have, uh, reached out for the niche, uh, auto parts and furniture influencers, and this is how, uh, we have made this strategy. And apart from that, I have worked with my team, uh, especially with the Amazon teams from Shanghai, work with them in implementing Amazon campaigns for our brand, for branding and overall, uh, the value generation as well as, uh, increasing the overall visibility of Amazon page. So this is how, uh, I have helped the company in getting more revenue and helping them in, uh, getting, uh, more visibility and make them a strong brand among their competitors. Thank you.\n'], [""Interviewer: That's quite impressive. Given your experience with influencer marketing and AI tools for influencer selection, could you detail the criteria used to identify the most effective influencers for your campaigns? How did you measure the effectiveness of these criteria, and were there any adjustments made based on the campaign's performance?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Definitely. So in our, uh, company, we use this, uh, international marketing tool called High Colliter. So using this tool, we check the whole engagement, estimated cost, and our collaboration time with the influencer. And based on that, we reached out to the influencers based on the engagement, their niche category, their followers, their audience, whether they are based in New Year or they are based in Europe. So we check all these things using this AI tool. And apart from that, we use their GPD, uh, for campaign drafting, for templates, for hashtags, as well as the descriptions which we send to the influencers. And this thing has actually helped us in getting more, uh, traction and made our work more easy and as well as increase our productivity. So this is how, uh, we, uh, have these are the techniques that we use for influencer marketing. And in influencer marketing, uh, like, I have around 6 years of experience in managing agencies as well. So we are collaborating with agencies as well for influencer, store promotion, and, uh, we also hire influencers through agencies as well. And regarding the negotiations, uh, we have the strategy. We, uh, look out to the influencer profile. Suppose that influencer is, uh, doing so much of home decor items. He is into funny second degree. So we look at the home and look at their, like, spaces and what kind of things. She she has an outdoor garden. So we will recommend her items ready to go out for garden, which she actually needs. So in that way, we, uh, have achieved significant bottle collaboration as well. We have the barter collaborations with, uh, in cancer called Kamna Hospital, and she's one of the top that, you know, transfer in US in DIY category. And we, uh, I looked at her, uh, like, backyard. She needed a fire table. She doesn't have a fire table at the time. So we shipped the fire table to her. And, uh, I had a negotiation with her. We had a call, and then I discussed that this this is the thing that we are, you know, planning to ship and how this thing will help her audience in being more engaged, and this is something she and her audience both will love. So she agreed to the barter collaboration. Uh, so this is how we reach out to influencers, check their needs, and, uh, we want them to closely we work with them closely and, uh, hold some strategy for beneficial for mutual beneficial of influencer as well as our brand. Apart from that, we are very cordial, and we always, uh, reply to the influencers for time and take care, uh, about their needs, and we'll make sure that the influencers will be posting, uh, the pending post on time as well. Thank you.\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach to influencer selection and engagement strategy is quite comprehensive. Regarding the AI tool Hypetrack, how do you ensure the data accuracy and reliability of the engagement metrics provided by the tool, especially given that influencer engagement metrics can sometimes be inflated or manipulated?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so first of all, we checked, uh, the inferencing data and the engagement to high quality. So apart from that, we have our own CPM calculation method. In CPM, we prefer the greatest with a CPM of less than 15. CPM is like, uh, like, you know, the cost per 1,000, uh, views. The cost in USD per 1,000 views. So make sure that, uh, the CPA would influence us less than 15. And apart from that, we also check, uh, the engagement manually. So What we do is that we go to the Instructure profile and check out the top 5 videos, like, recent 5 videos, and check out the total engagement and total reach. Uh, like, suppose it has, uh, total, uh, you know, view of 1 lakh in the last 5 videos. And the average will be 20,000 for 1 video. And based on that, we will be calculating the CPM. And apart from that, we'll be checking if the influencer recently had a viral post or something. And suppose she had raised her recent temp post had 1,000,000. So based on that, we see the annual impression that we would reach. And apart from that, we check the comments as well because comments should be, uh, like, general if the, you know, the comments user the commenting user are actual or more. So we check that manually as well as ping then make sure that the inferencing we are collaborating with must be of high quality so that we can achieve our highest ROI as well as, uh, our CPM would be the least. Thank you.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear you have a robust system for vetting influencers. Shifting focus to your data analysis skills, could you describe a scenario where you used data analysis to optimize a marketing campaign? What specific metrics did you focus on, and how did the insights from the data analysis drive your decision-making process?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Yes. Definitely, John. So I as I mentioned, I led an Agile campaign to eat a home. So in that campaign, uh, there were around 50 products, and I was, uh, designing the landing page of the campaign, uh, with our product and design team. So I observed data on the sales data, uh, through data and analysis, this is I observed that there are 5 essence of the actual which I have the highest sales. And it was very evident that those XDRs are very competitive, and these are one of our best selling products. So the core of the campaign was generating the highest revenue. I have collaborated with the Amazon team and checked the item was abundant in store. So we, uh, on the front page, we made sure that through data analysis, we added most 5 x shares on the top of the campaign as the main highlight because this is the product that is currently worth selling. And we want to increase the visibility of 1 product because if we have a one very highly popular product, then brand awareness will increase as well. Also, our customer will see if the quality of brand is good, and then, uh, they will, uh, shift to the, uh, checking out or figuring out some new products for them as well. So we, uh, added those 2, 5 tables, uh, in the 2, 5 chairs in the campaign, uh, in the front page. And after that, uh, we added those new ASMs which we want to promote because, uh, it was, like, the Black Friday sale and the year was almost approaching. It was ending. So we added the our latest arrivals for 2024, the next year, uh, below those 2, 5 trending products so that we also promoted our best products, upcoming best products through, uh, the campaign. So the campaign had a very great sale. We had achieved 100 k USD plus sales in just a week, uh, for the ad sales. And it was a massive success for the team, and it was really, like, uh, a big massive success, uh, during the Black Friday sale for the company. Thank you.\n'], ['Interviewer: Given the significant impact of your data-driven campaign on Amazon, could you elaborate on the process of selecting the initial five products for the campaign? How did your data analysis approach differentiate between high competition products and those with high potential for visibility and sales growth?  \n', 'Interviewee: Yes. I as I already mentioned, for, uh, the top five products, we have, uh, checked the sales data. And due to, uh, after data analysis, we added the top five best selling products on the sheet because the major most of the campaigns were increasing the sales, uh, during, uh, that quarter. So, uh, uh, we made around 100 k USD of sales, and around 70% of the sales were to the the top 5 x shares that were already wholesaling items, and 20% were the new items, uh, sales to generated for the new items that we were planning to promote in 20 24. There those are our latest arrivals. So by mixing those trending products and latest arrivals, we we will be very sure that, uh, there will be high visibility for those products. And also, we have promoted the new products to Android app during the same time. So that apart from these trending products, we can have some new trending products as well. And this campaign did really well our new items. We also would put you some of the sales for the new items as well, which we have just recently launched at the time. This is how we have, uh, increased the overall, uh, revenue as well as, uh, promoting the new products for our company, uh, through Amazon Champions. Thank you.\n'], [""Interviewer: Your approach to balancing the promotion of established best-sellers with new arrivals is strategic. In terms of the new products introduced during the campaign, how did you define and measure their success? What metrics or benchmarks were used to evaluate whether a new product's introduction was considered successful, and did this feedback loop influence your future product selection for campaigns?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. So our major goal was we want to sell at least 200 of those x s on of the new arrivals, uh, on our Amazon campaign. So during that time, uh, we had a sales of 20,000 USD, and we have, uh, scored around, uh, 1, uh, 1 50 of those HCS new HCS. So, see, the goal was, like, really on a higher side because for a new product getting 1, uh, 200 of sales is sometimes a bit challenging. But, uh, the management and team members, they were very, uh, uh, happy with the seeing the growth and because we did it through one campaign only. We didn't promote the ad sales, uh, you know, through some other methods through, uh, you know, some I'm gonna add as well. So that's why they, uh, were very happy with the performance. And later in the campaign after 1st week, we started promoting those new products to Amazonas as well. And we have seen a tremendous growth in the sales volume of the new products, and new product alone was considered successful at the time. This is our approach. And, uh, the metrics that we use for, um, the, uh, you know, for the improvement of, uh, our sales as well as the considering the success of our new launches is that this should be, uh, a decent clicks as well as because we want to make check the product pictures as well. If, you know, if their customer are coming to the landing page, it means that, uh, that they're clear on the product picture. It means that the pictures are already good. And because it's a new product, there were no not many reviews. So we have made sure the description is, like, really crisp, and we have highlighted the means from points of the chairs in the first, uh, you know, first paragraphs of the, um, description of the Amazon Edge chairs. So this is how, uh, we, uh, you know, promoted the chair. And for the success of the campaign, the goal was around 200 and at least 2,000 clicks and 200 of sales. Uh, this was the goal, and we have achieved around 5,000 clicks and around 150, uh, tiers in the selling volume. So that's, uh, how we have managed the campaign, and this is how we have described the success of the campaign for the new launches. Thank you.\n""], ['Interviewer: The focus on both sales volume and engagement metrics, such as clicks and landing page interactions, is insightful. How do you approach the challenge of establishing trust and credibility for new products, especially in the absence of many reviews, and how does this factor into your marketing and communication strategies for new product launches?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yes. For new products, our major goal is to promote them with the older products that are doing already well. And apart from that, we use Amazon ads as well, and we will influence the marketing majorly. We send these new products. We've given before launch. Suppose if the product is about to launch in March, so we will start shipping the product in January to the influencer and our vendor will post by February, February ending. Suppose if the, uh, loans date is, uh, March 1, then we will make sure the post are done by March 30. So if, uh, March February 28, this is our timeline. And then Spencer will tell to the their audience that, you know, this is a new product. I have received the limited edition, this new product from. And this is the newest HCL, and I found it really cool to make sure that our product is best in class and the inferences we see too are relevant, uh, for the product. And we before announcing the product, we make good, uh, content available even on the, uh, influencers side, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube as well. And also, we, uh, also have connection with the blog post as well, which we will write out about the new launches of our product, about our company. So we'll also promote those products on our those schedule as well. And apart from that, from the new products, we also use deal groups. There are so many deal groups we are in touch with. And also, there are so many deal websites in the US, flex details we use on them. We have partners with them, and we ship out we promote our new products, uh, on their website as well. And we provide special discount codes, uh, for our new launches and coupons so that customers can check those products initially. And, uh, you know, we can promote our products. And for the like, reviewing the note, uh, we send our product to influencers so that they can test the products. And if they really like the, you know, the product, then they will, you know, tell good things about the products on their platforms and people will be genuinely buying the products. And so this is the initial phase. Once we make sure the quality of products is really good, in the later phases, uh, the customer reviews come out to be posted because we make sure that the customer experience is our priority and the products will see follow the best quality to the to customers as well as to the influencer. Thank you.\n""], ['Interviewer: Your comprehensive approach to launching new products, encompassing influencer engagement, content marketing, and strategic partnerships for reviews and promotions, is quite detailed. How do you plan to scale these initiatives for new product launches, especially considering the need to maintain high-quality and authentic engagement as volumes increase?  \n', ""Interviewee: So yeah. Also, in that scenario, uh, we make sure that the quality of the products we are seeing in the influences are too close. And quality of the reviews are maintained, uh, by because we make sure that the customer reviews are genuine. So if there is some issues that our users are facing, so we contact those, ask them to share their, uh, numbers, their customer support as well, and we try to reach out to the customers and ask them, like, what are the issues they are facing. If they are facing some, you know, real issues, the product has arrived damaged, broken, and that's why they put a bad review on the MRO. So we asked them to, uh, we'll ask them for an replacement. We send the best product in replacement and make sure that other customer experience will not, uh, suffer. And after the, uh, right product has been signed, we are comfortable. Uh, if they are willing to change the review, they can change the review because we customer satisfaction are priority. And for scaling those campaigns, initially, we use in customer marketing, Amazon ads, and also our blog post and our deal website for promoting our products. We have like occasional campaigns, monthly campaigns on Amazon for our new arrivals. Like summer campaign, autumn campaign, uh, like season wise we have multiple campaigns and also we promote our product doing Black Friday sales as well. So this is our strategy for promoting the new products and scaling the campaigns for both products. Thank you.\n""], ['Interviewer: Your emphasis on customer feedback and the proactive approach to addressing issues to enhance the overall customer experience and product quality is commendable. How do you envision leveraging technology, such as AI and data analytics, to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes, particularly in the realm of influencer management and customer engagement?  \n', 'Interviewee: Yes. Uh, so our support team, they are using the AI based, uh, chat chat support. So, you know, we are implementing those AI tools in our chat support as well so that we can increase the efficiency, and one person can handle 2, 3, uh, queries with chat support in one time. You need to handle the AI. We are using AI for, uh, reverting to our customers. And apart from that, we are using AI for, uh, checking out the trends in the market. Also, checking out, uh, you know, everything related to the marketing domain, what are our competitors are doing, what kind of products they are working really well in the market. So this is how we are leveraging AI and data analysis in promoting our products and helping the company grow. Thank you.\n'], ['Interviewer: Integrating AI into your customer support processes and market research initiatives is a strategic move. How do you ensure that the AI tools used for trend analysis and competitor research provide accurate and actionable insights, and what metrics do you use to measure the effectiveness of these AI applications in your decision-making processes?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yes. We do not rely on this one AI software. We get data from multiple AI sources. Uh, and apart from that, we have our own Amazon data as well. So we try to do the data analysis by keep making a report, keeping all the AI data as well as our internal Amazon data and our campaign data. So combining both these 3, uh, functional, uh, information, we make a strategy based on that, and based on that, we make the decision. We don't make this decision based on this one report. We figure out, uh, multiple reports and figure out what is right thing, uh, to do for our company, what is the brand most, and based on that, we create strategies using the AI tools as well as our internal data.\n""], ['Interviewer: Diversifying your data sources for strategic decision-making, including both AI-driven insights and internal campaign data, is a robust approach. How do you see the role of AI evolving in the field of influencer marketing and content strategy, and what are some potential areas where you believe AI could have a significant impact on your current practices?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yes. No. AI has been evolving, like, really to a next level because there are already some softwares in that market for influencer marketing, which are AI based and which will help you in helping the influencer or getting influencer for the brand. So there are some AI tools which will, uh, if you go to the tools, and they will send automated emails about your interest to them. They will send automated, uh, Instagram messages to an AI, uh, using your the AI tool. So, uh, AI has been, uh, it has a, like, really big score in terms of marketing and campaigns, and it has been already seen through automatic AI generated newsletters. We are has been a tool for insider club, which helps influencers, uh, in, uh, connecting with their audience. Both I'm an influencer, and I have around 100 k followers. And, you know, I can have a separate community moving to AI tool. And every time I post a video, my all my followers who have subscribed to me, they will get a newsletter that, hi. This is, uh, influencer and she won't be as posted a video recently. You can click on the link below, and you can you can see, uh, the video using the link below. So this will help the influencer getting more leads and, you know, staying connected better with the audience. And if necessary, he doesn't have to do much. He just because the older message, everything will be generated. And below the, uh, agent, it will be some promotions as well as coupon codes and everything which can be used by its followers. And you know, also, uh, the followers, they can use the coupon code and do shopping. And if they're doing shopping, and the influencer, because they're using the influencer's link, we will be getting some additional remaining as well, uh, through AI, and it will be all tracked automatically by AI. He must have doesn't have to, uh, you know, do much or, uh, mandate his own links or something. It will be done by AI only. And it there'll be a dashboard in which influencer can see monthly income as well. So this is how AI has been changing the overall influencer marketing landscape. For influencer, it is helping influencer engineering more than we were saying, uh, more, uh, closely with their audiences, staying better in touch with them, and also generating more revenue as well as getting more reach. And for the companies, AI is helping, uh, gather companies, reaching the influencers, uh, by through and telling about the brands. And, uh, also, uh, AI will be, you know, minimizing the workload of the influencer marketing managers in the coming weeks as well. So this is how I believe AI is, uh, changing, uh, influencer marketing space. And using the AI, you can even do trends analysis. You can check what is the latest trends on multiple websites. And AI can even design a complete influencer marketing campaign for you. If you search about, uh, like, what kind of campaigns are currently in trend, and the AI will help you with that in figuring out the right campaign for your brand. You can even ask AI, this is my into this space, and we want to, uh, be the best in that space. And also, we want to, uh, design a campaign for our best part of the product. So can we select some campaigns? Here, we come up with, uh, one of, uh, the good ideas for the campaigns and later you can change the campaign according to what you need, but it will help you in brainstorming as well.

So what we do that we reach out to that panel individually if we check that if they anyone can of then can accommodate any interview dates. So what we try to do is matching the slot as quickly as possible because the slots books very fast because there is not a one candidate. There is multiple candidates. So what we do that, we individually connect with that interviewer and ask them if you can upload it this slot or you can suggest us any slot in which you can available. So we try to convert that slot to the interviewers. So, uh, that's how we manage the high demand from the candidate side, and we're able to accommodate the interview with the different types of interviewer with the different candidates.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a very efficient approach using the Amazon hiring tool and manual coordination when necessary. Shifting focus to your strategic vision for recruitment solutions, can you describe a time when you identified a need for a new recruitment strategy and how you went about implementing it? What were the key factors you considered in the development of this strategy?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. 1st first of all, what we did that, uh, first of all, we did a meeting with the hiring managers. And because the hiring managers requirement are must, so we check all the requirements which were required by the hiring managers. After that, we go through our previous candidate, which are in our portfolio like, in our pipeline. So we go through them. If we find a suitable candidate, we again go through that interview process and, uh, process the things which we are, like, in the format. And after that, what we did that if they we don't have any, uh, candidate in our pipeline, which was previously applied in in our company, what we do that, uh, we go to LinkedIn and different job portals, and we find that particular candidate. If we are able to found that, like, first, we publish the job in the job portals. And if we receive any application, we provide we proceed with the candidate where human screening and assessment and all the things. And if, uh, if we if we have a candidate which we need to contact directly, we can contact direct to them by on the LinkedIn or their email. And after that, we profit, uh, proceed with their uh, formal procedure, which we have, like a assessment, uh, and resume reviewing, and, uh, interview different level of interview, what type of interview we need to set as a live quote or something like that. So, uh, these strategies we apply. Like, we the main strategy is that we have to look at that candidate which previously applied in a in a company if they are suitable for that role as per the hiring manager. So, yeah, we can proceed with them also. It will, uh, it will cost effective and a fast way of hiring.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that you place a strong emphasis on leveraging existing talent pipelines and engaging with potential candidates on platforms like LinkedIn. Given your experience with community management, how have you integrated community engagement into your recruitment strategies, and what impact has it had on your ability to attract and retain top talent?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. The community management is the play key role in the organization because whenever we, uh, engage the candidate with that, uh, we whenever we engage the employee in the community management, what happened is that they feel like, right, that, yeah, companies, uh, organization is doing something for us. Like, they are providing us party, and, uh, they are gathering to get together. And yeah. So what we do that? First of all, from my suggestions to retain the candidate, what we need to do that, we need to make a portal. In that portal, what we can do that, we can provide an open forum where the employees can put their problem feedback and all the details to us so we can move forward with that. And if there are any issues the prop employee situation, we can directly resolve that issue. Because, uh, what happened is that whenever the comp whenever the employee is leaving the organization, there must be some issue in that. So what we can do with that forum is we can identify that issue and resolve that issue. And after resolving that issue, we can retain the top candidates. Uh, retain all the candidates. Not only top candidates, all the candidates necessary for our organization. So, yeah, if there are some issue, we can help we can solve that. And that community engagement, this is a major part. Like, uh, creating a forum from our company, it is a major part in the community engagement because where all the community members can engage and have their conversation, like providing feedback, providing any issues they are facing, providing any type of problem so that we can solve that as an HR of the company, we are the we are the only people to hear the candidate issues and solve them. Uh, as per because of the community engagement, what happened is that they're openly they can openly tell any issue, and we can make them anonymous also. Because make them anonymous, they can feel confident, and we are also getting them some type of problem which they are facing. And if there any specific issue at all the issues cannot be specific. It it can be in the, uh, company level also. We can solve them issue, and the community engagement plays the most important and critical part in all the employees so that, uh, they can perform good, and we also can retain them.\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach to community management is indeed comprehensive, focusing on both social events and a feedback portal for issue resolution. This strategy not only fosters a sense of belonging but also provides a platform for continuous improvement. Considering your proficiency in the MS Office suite, can you tell me about a time when you used these tools to streamline HR processes or to analyze data for talent management needs?  \n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. I can tell you that where I can use the I used in Power BI. In that, uh, what we do that, we take the data from all the employees which are working in the team. And after that, we check that how many hours, how many minutes the team is taking to complete a one particular task. And after that, uh, we checked all the data. We make, uh, average data in that. And, uh, after making that average, we tell our employees that we need to particularly fix this task in that particular time. So yeah. For the time saving and proficiency improving in our employees, so we need to I used to I'm with Power BI, and it is a form of Excel. And, uh, I used MS Excel as well. I used MS Word as well. In MS Excel, what we do that we you have to perform root cause analysis of that particular case. So in root cause analysis, we are able to find out all the things which happened and what and we performed the power, uh, RC in that. And in word, what we have to do, like, we have multiple templates, so we need to edit those templates also. So MS Word is very useful useful way in the, uh, formatting the templates. And after that, uh, we used to buy a pivot pivot table also. Pivot table is also very important, uh, in the MS Excel and MS Word.\n""], [""Interviewer: It's great to hear how you've leveraged Power BI and Excel for data analysis and root cause analysis, as well as using Word for template management. The use of pivot tables is particularly effective for summarizing and analyzing large datasets. Given your experience with these tools, how do you ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data you're analyzing, especially when making critical decisions based on that data?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Yes. As I told you that Power BI, uh, because we take the data from like, we have particular app bureau. So in that, what happened that the every every employee of that team captured that data. Like, uh, we have to schedule a task. Like, we have to schedule an interview. What happened in that, like, uh, from the beginning of that receiving that candidate in our total after till that we have scheduled? So we capture all the data, and it cover it comes in Excel. So, uh, we have to trust our employees be as they are entering the correct data. And we also have the average data so we can match that data with the employee which would enter. So what happened if we reset, we match the data which provided by the employee and after, uh, matching with that average data which we have. So we match both the datas. And if both the datas are correct, we forward with that particular efficiency of the candidate if there are any issue from that candidate side. So we, uh, from the employee side, we, uh, uh, convey that to the employee. And after that, after conveying that, we tell them to improve on that and that data we which we have the average of the data that plays a particular role because we take the further decision on based on that data.

It's clear that you have a methodical approach to data integrity, which is crucial for making informed decisions. Moving on, can you discuss how you've used your skills in employee relations to address any issues that arose from the data analysis, and how you've implemented changes to improve employee performance or satisfaction?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. I can tell you that one example that, uh, where we as I told you that one of the data which we entered in the app, so what happened there is, like, uh, there was some issue while, uh, facing while capturing the data. Like, we have if we are taking 2 minutes while scheduling, so sometime the employees are able to do that 4 minutes because of some emergency work. Like, uh, someone messaged them in on their messaging platform, uh, the company messaging platform. So what happened is that there was some miss misinterpretation that, uh, that employee is taking more time, but that's not correct because someone is messaging them on the official company messaging portal. So we need to solve that issue also. Like, both issues are very important because we don't focus on that particular scheduling task. We have to, uh, we have other works also. So what we do that, uh, at that time, uh, there as there are some other works also at that same time, what we did that, uh, we, uh, introduced 1, uh, one extra column. Like, if someone is messaging on us on the the messaging platform, on the company's messaging platform, what we did that, we put that code in that, like, company message. So what we do that, uh, at that time, we enter that company message and it not hampering our average data time also. So, yeah, we do that too. And as these re build the relation between us and the employee, so what happened is that that every time decree every time, uh, which was increasing previously is decreased, and it employer and it increases the employee performance also. Yeah. That's the build surplus between us and the employee, and, uh, we are able to solve that, uh, issues of the employees which are hitting.\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a very proactive approach to addressing the discrepancy in task completion times, and it's commendable how you've managed to both capture the context of interruptions and maintain an accurate record of task completion.

Given your experience in implementing such changes, how do you measure the impact of these adjustments on employee performance and satisfaction, and what metrics do you use to track these improvements?  \n"", ""Interviewee: Uh, like I told you that, uh, we have that data which comes in the Power BI. So what we do that, uh, if the employee is doing the great work, like, uh, above average work and the good work, so we recognize that in that, uh, monthly meetings also, and we provide token of appreciation. And, uh, we have doing that work, uh, from the previous times. So this, uh, increase the morale of the employee, and it helps the employee to work, um, more better. So, yeah, we do the needfuls for the every employee which they can perform. And, uh, yeah, I can say that we, uh, we recognize the employee's work, and they are also perform very well if they are, uh, like, from, uh, I can take me with an example. I was the one of the best employee of the month at the time of my joining. I when I joined after that 1 or 2 month, I got the Tesla award, and it creates a good with goodwill. And, uh, after that, I performed well.

It's great to hear that you have a system in place to acknowledge and appreciate exceptional performance, which undoubtedly contributes to a positive work environment. In addition to individual recognition, do you also track team performance metrics, and if so, how do you ensure that team dynamics and collaboration are fostered while still recognizing individual contributions?  \n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Our team was measured. The team performance also because there are some different, uh, departments. Like, we worked in EMEA region, like, uh, Europe, Europe, Middle East, and Africa. And the other teams working working on the North America, some working in ASEAN region, some working in Indian region. So we compare all the data with that other team also, like, uh, the any region. Like, North America region is were doing, like, scheduling work in 10 minutes. The whole should be doing it 10 minutes, and we are doing it in 8 minutes. So we compare the quota data, and if we are doing good, like, uh, that also recognized. The teamwork also recognized in the quarterly meetings. Yeah. So after that, uh, if there are any such type of improvement which they are required, like, uh, we the people from our email regions goes to any region people and tell them that, uh, where the where the things can be improved. Like, uh, if there are any particular challenge they are facing, if something is happening, so we can, uh, able to tackle that differences also. And we were able to match that. Like, all the teams must have the same timeline. Like, if we are taking 10 minutes, mostly the other team take 11 minutes or 12 minutes, max to max, 12 minutes. Uh, more than that, it will affect the company benefits. So, yeah, that is a major cause that we have to check the data of the other departments also, and we look into that. And if there are any diff discrepancies in that, we solve that. And, uh, as I told you that we go to that department and their people comes to us if we are facing any problem, and they we both help each other.

The first of all, that, uh, the cross region training and the knowledge transfer is that we maintain a one language, which is English. So for all the department, the English language is necessary to we have. Like, we need to communicate in English only, and as you told that there are, uh, issues with the time zones. Yeah. That is correct. Like, uh, what we do that we come sometime we did the night shift, and sometime we did the evening shifts. And what happen if that particular employee is not available? It may be. It may do not be not available. But what we do that, we drop an email, and, uh, we can come back and check later. And if, uh, is there any type of emergencies there, we can connect with them because sometime it's happened. We need to connect with that employee and which we need to check what's happening. And knowledge transfer is must. So, yeah, uh, the that time zone issue, which it is not impacting us much more because the our like, in Amazon, what happened is that they are working 247. That, uh, sometime evening shift will work, sometime night shift will work, sometime morning shift will work. So time zone issue, it was an autumn barrier in Amazon because it works on 247 environment. But, uh, yeah, uh, we maintain that English language is must for every employee. They must learn that language so that there must be not mean an issue while, uh, you know, doing some knowledge transfer and yeah.\n""], [""Interviewer: Maintaining English as the common language is a practical approach to ensure effective communication across global teams. It's also good to hear that you have a flexible approach to shifts and use asynchronous communication methods like email to bridge the gap when immediate contact isn't possible.

As I can told you that if someone is sitting in the Paris office, they usually speak in French. So we have regional department also for them. And if they want to come like, if they want to talk to any global team, what they can do that, they can take the help from their superior and their teammates. So they will definitely help them. And at the time of entry in Amazon, there was the requirement that you need to be learn English as much. And if you are good at read a language, that is also not an issue. Like, in the mostly, the cross region things happen sometimes in a month or in in a quarter. So, yeah, mostly what's happened in the local language so that local language will help them. And if there are any type of issue they are facing, like, uh, in speaking English and something like that, we have regular training sessions also, and we have the KT, the k net trainings, which we have, which, uh, which the HR team designs for them.

We use something called SVCJ, stochastic volatility correlated jump, to price in, uh, options on BTC. Although we didn't trade options at 0.86, but, uh, information in options were were pretty much relevant there. The other things that I sort of, you know, uh, helped other thing that helped me here at Point ECX in Quant was, uh, my experience with order books.

There is some sort of, uh, premium that goes on in here. Liquidity is a bit different. So trading those, uh, liquid illiquid options and payers, uh, understanding of them sort of help me here build those strategies, uh, to sort of, you know, exploit the alpha and, uh, get the ball rolling for the team.

Given\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given the non-normal distribution of BTC and the focus on market-neutral strategies, how did you adjust your model to account for this, and what were some of the key challenges you faced in implementing this non-standard modeling approach in a practical trading environment?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Uh, issues that we faced, uh, effectively, what happened is, uh, BTC let's say, in an international market, a BTC USD or a BTC USD pair, in itself, modeling that is a bit difficult. But, uh, there are no liquidity challenges there. Uh, modeling it there is sort of like introducing a jump parameter in our modeling of, let's say, simple black shows or a, uh, stochastic, uh, black shows equation. And then maybe we can go from there. Uh, but a challenge that Indians or Indian market would face is, uh, it's built upon a upon a stable coin premium. So you have to, uh, account for that. So that that requires, uh, 2 form of understanding of things. 1 would be a stable coin premium plus the underlying, uh, underlying b t BTC issue. Now to tackle those challenges of the non normal distribution, uh, we sort of had a look at the actual BTC prices or the actual BTC auction prices that is where they are at. Uh, so compared with normal, what we have observed at BTC distribution, uh, compared to a normal or a bell curve is is is sort of, like, longer, uh, at the center, but thinner at the center, and the tails are thicker. So what it means is BTC doesn't move much, but when it does, it does, uh, jump a lot. So we just made a few changes in our strategies accounting for that. Uh, one example would be that, let's say, when I'm trading, uh, for market meeting, and if the spreads are normally in a in in in a very stable or a mature market, the spreads change basis volatility when our market making would would largely follow some form of normal distribution. But at Bitcoin, the spreads, uh, versus volatility, uh, at a very low volatility, we could keep, uh, spreads lower and make money. But as soon as, uh, volatility increased slightly, the spread that we adjusted for were pretty high. So this is an explanation for the thing, uh, for the change in the normal distribution of Bitcoin, uh, versus a traditional asset wherein, you know, the the the the tails are thicker and the centerpiece is thinner and longer. Your\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your detailed explanation highlights the complexities of modeling and trading BTC, especially in the context of market dynamics and liquidity variations. How did you quantify and manage the stablecoin premium and its impact on trading strategies, given its significant influence on certain pairs?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Uh, we have a pair called USDT INR, Tether INR, which is, uh, the most liquid in Indian markets. Uh, what we had come to realize is the the stable coins premium with, let's say, a dollar INR, uh, value is is is function of, uh, three things, basically. 1 would be your regulatory enrollment. So whenever there is some form of, like, regulatory uncertainty or people who want to exit, uh, crypto market in general, uh, that premium sort of shrinks. The other would be, uh, whenever, uh, there is demand to buy BTC in India relative when I say demand to buy, relative to the rest of the world. For example, there may be a selling pressure in the, uh, rest of the world, but let's say the selling pressure or the selling volume or the selling intensity is Indian low. In that case, that premium would expand because it makes sense for people to actually buy USDT and then use that USDT to sort of, like, buy, uh, BTC. So that premium is sort of like a vote on India's propensity to hold, uh, crypto in general versus the rest of the world. Uh, and adjusting for some form of regulatory and the friction in moving, uh, money around. So let's let me give an example. Let's just say the regulatory and the friction. Like, uh, INR is one way convertible currency. Uh, that, uh, regulatory friction and the other thing, let's say, it account for 2 and a half percent premium. Anything more than 2 and a half percent in my model or in my trading, I would attribute it to the India India population's propensity to hold cryptocurrencies in general. So that sort of, like, is the word on that. Uh, one of the example is whenever there were regular regulatory uncertainties in India about banning crypto or, uh, stuff like that, uh, a year or 2 back, uh, this this actually premium turned into a discount. It traded below the INR, uh, USDT market. So there are qualitative aspects and quantitative aspect both in managing that premium of stablecoin. Under\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Understanding the factors influencing the stablecoin premium in the INR market is crucial for effective trading strategy. How do you approach the integration of qualitative and quantitative factors into your models or trading decisions, especially in situations where qualitative aspects may not have clear numerical representations?  \n\n', 'Interviewee: Uh, this is wherein, uh, we had, uh, we took help from Offshik. This is wherein, uh, they we they they, with the health analytics, had built some form of scraping from Twitter and other things. And, uh, we adjusted our parameter based on those, uh, feedbacks. But everything qualitative, uh, whenever we cannot quantify we could not quantify it, uh, had to be sort of, you know, tinkled with parameters manually. Whenever we could quantify it, for example, if the premium is going down, uh, we know that, you know, the demand, uh, for BTC, uh, in India is, uh, compared to the rest of the world, is slightly less. We can, uh, sometimes, uh, you know, uh, go short on a BTC thing. If if premium is expanding pretty aggressively, we could go long on BTC because everyone is going long. But a lot of those qualitative factor, which cannot be quantified since you asked about non quantifiable qualitative factor, I had a whole, uh, team of traders. Uh, think of those traders as a sell side bank test wherein they run their OTC desk. So we had inventory and warehousing of things, and those qualitative factors were taken care by my team from that part of the team. So I had 2 teams. 1 who was doing solely quantitative stuff. The other were discretionary trader, uh, who sort of would take care of, uh, qualitative aspect for the team.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: Integrating sentiment analysis from sources like Twitter is innovative for adjusting trading parameters.

Uh, whenever there was now to make sure that, you know, the the the sentiment analysis or, uh, whatever we are doing, why Twitter is not giving up on, What we did is, uh, we sort of looked at the real world signal as well. For example, when there was, uh, BTC, ETF news, there were a lot of preemptive sentiment, uh, on on Twitter, which had to be checked with other, uh, mainstream news sources as well. So once our Twitter thing, uh, is there, if we we didn't go all in on the trade, we just, uh, were sort of, like, cautious and, you know, maybe initiate a little bit of trade and be, uh, be ready to, you know, get a bit, uh, higher quantity trading in in in in the market. But once as soon as the news is, uh, sort of, like, confirmed by one thing or the other, uh, we sort of, uh, jumped into a trade. So Twitter was just one of our parameter. Uh, sentiment from website scraping and other thing is just one of one of one of the parameter. Then have very large weight. Uh, it become important around certain, uh, turning point in the market. This was not always relevant. For example, when there's a huge sell off, uh, when, uh, when there is a very large open interest, let's say, around, uh, option expiry or even there is when the funding rate between futures and BTC, uh, b BTC spot is pretty high. In that case, we we felt that, you know, uh, this could be relevant. Under normal circumstances, that didn't play much into our trading. Given\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given the critical role of qualitative factors in your trading strategy, how do you envision leveraging AI or machine learning models to better incorporate and perhaps even automate the adjustment process based on qualitative inputs?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Input that option he needs to do. Uh, I think it's pretty easily, uh, uh, can be pretty easily handled by, uh, by an AI model. For example, a lot of scraping that is done is simply a code, uh, which can be scrapped. This is that, uh, an AI model can simply, uh, sort of, you know, uh, have some form of qualitative score score, something like a greed or a fear index that we have for equity market. That sort of index can be built by an AI model, which obviously can be refined as, you know, uh, it gets trained over more data, uh, to to figure that out. How that reacts, how that greed and, uh, fear index once we have derived that greed and fear mix via AI, how that is leveraged, uh, with the actual actions in the market. For example, when the market is pretty much, uh, to the greed side, and let's say, uh, how how are the jumps looking? So in that case, my assumption this is how we did it qualitatively was every downward down should move down jumps were pretty, uh, aggressive and swift, but the up moves were, uh, sort of, like, drifting in nature. So that sort of thing with AI can pretty easily be done. I think, uh, the whole qualitative aspect of things current pretty much, uh, the level that we were doing can pretty much be automated by an by an AI. The only place I think human, uh, touch would be required is via the experience or, uh, the parameters of the area that AI is not looking at. Because, uh, as I said previously, there are times when one factors are, uh, you know, very important as compared to the other. So PB and AI would probably take time on training, shifting from one driver to the other driver. That's the only challenge AI would face with regard to, uh, qualitative factors. So AI plus sort of like an human observer, uh, is pretty much, uh, something that can be replaced whatever we were doing with, uh, our strategies. Consider\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Considering the potential for AI to handle qualitative aspects, how do you plan to ensure the interpretability and transparency of these AI models, especially in an industry like finance where understanding the ""why"" behind a decision is crucial for trust and risk management?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Start, uh, one one way to build trust, uh, especially in in an in a Fintech or a finance sector would be to have an, uh, human observation. Maybe you can, uh, over a period of time. The second thing is backtesting the AI itself, like, which, uh, which are the turning points. Just like any other program or any other coding, uh, things, I think there are gonna be tail cases. Uh, identifying those tail cases could be pretty important. Again, uh, this is very in a very large set of data, at testing things, where the things are going haywire, uh, can come into the picture. We can add a layer of, uh, permission, uh, if AI based decisions are there. For example, not going beyond, uh, certain things, and we can have a strict stop loss. So my point is we already have, uh, CTAs or algorithmic trading, right, uh, built into the system. And AI is sort of, like, expanding that domain with lot of qualitative factors, uh, maybe quantifying them into, uh, an, let's say, a greed or fear index or some form of rankings, uh, to sort of, uh, enhance those. So just like our, uh, algorithmic trading or height, uh, high frequency trading has happened, has evolved over a period of time, it doesn't always make money. Sometimes there is a need for a human observer to make sure the risks are, uh, managed correctly.

Like, a lot of risk management that happens are rule based in in financial firms and other places. For example, when your leverage goes beyond these things and, you know, like, focusing on sudden risk, for example, currently, I would say, uh, Israeli run risk. I think a lot of equity managers would be or crypto managers would be paying attention to. These are all, uh, I mean, pretty much, uh, lot of things that are done by human can be done by AI. And lot of decision makings, which are simply rule based. Uh, lot of those decision makings are if then else in nature. For example, this is the risk. We calculate bar and we say that, hey. We need to reduce the risk. And then this is where in in AI, which, let's say, our trading program can come into picture and opportunistically can reduce the position. Keep an eye for the hedges if so a lot of, uh, these things at at least at at older or, you know, of of of of traditional houses that happens, most of it are if then else, uh, system monitored by a human being. So that is, I'm guessing, pretty much easily automatable, uh, by by an AI. The benefit with AI as compared to a traditional coding would be, uh, the longer it can run, the longer the better it can get trained, uh, which probably was not there with the traditional, uh, coding or something like a conditional, uh, coding, uh, previously. As\n\n""], ['Interviewer: As AI systems learn and adapt, how do you propose to manage the potential for AI to develop unexpected behaviors or strategies that may not align with the intended risk management goals, especially in complex and interconnected financial markets?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: So for example, this is not a new problem, to be very fair. Uh, this problem, I think when we started, uh, I think when I say we, when humans started, uh, with the algorithm trading, this was there with algorithm trading as well. How do we manage, uh, the sizes of the position, the leverage, or the the adverse, uh, potential of losses? And this is wherein we we came up with a rule based system. We came up with, uh, systems wherein, you know, limiting the AI in certain cases. So I think those conditions can automatically be in built. Uh, I don't see it different than a human trading. For example, when a trader a human trader is taking position, there are certain limits on it. You cannot go beyond this risk. You cannot take this many positions. Uh, the net position or the net d v zero one or sensitivity or whatever drivers cannot be higher than this one. This can be sort of, like, uh, implemented within AI system as well. The other thing is at least till the time AI is training, we can have, uh, 2 order of, uh, sort of, like, uh, lock locking mechanism wherein, you know, once, uh, if something goes on in the first order, the second, uh, code or a second form of a technology can take care that, you know, the systems are, uh, working properly as in, you know, uh, the strategy stops there itself.

I had calls I had multiple calls with the start up founders to understand the business model, the strengths, the competitive landscape, how they were benefited to start this project or company? What was the USP of the team? And then I designed pictures which were basically investment memos that was sent to the committee before a Zoom call was planned. With 4 to 5 different startups pitching at any given point in time. So it was a 1 hour meeting in which 4 to 5 startups used to come and pitch like, maybe 10 minutes to the investment committee.

The fund administrator administration fund, team, which was involved in making sure that the check is issued to the right team. And, yeah, I think they were these. So I basically built a tracker and worked with all of these teams to make sure that one, we follow-up process flow. So in order to make sure we do that, at that point in time, we were using Google Sheets. Which was based and designed in a way that every team gets a notification when a task is due at their end So this made sure that we did every task and this reduced the time from closing a deal in 45 days to just 15 days.

Can you describe the high-level solution architecture or approach you would take to build this tool?\n', ""Interviewee: Very interesting. So I would divvy up So into 3 parts for early stage investing. Analyzing the market, analyzing the team, analyzing the product. These are the 3 key things that I would look at when evaluating an early stage investment, especially the team. Now how would an AI do this? I would think that the market piece would be very easy to build On EA. So when I say market, it's basically analyzing, 1, is there a need for the product? 2, how big is the market? 3 what is the competitive landscape that looks like? Say for example in India, or US. For a market For example, pet supplies. So all of these things can be AI built or driven Once we can set up information sources that the AI can learn From Now these sources could be anything and everything right from consumer behavioral changes, how is the market moving, what are the revenue streams looking like in some industries, Do we see a niche popping up? Do we see any new I would say, yeah. So these things. The second piece, which is the team, I think is something that I would most rely on a human To evaluate, when I say team, it's so after doing a basic check, which again can AI can do, which is what's the team pedigree, where what's the education background? What's their professional qualification? Why are they best suited to start this company, etcetera, and what's the dynamic of the Team's truck structure, what is the equity split, etcetera. All of these things can be automated, but what I would rely a human on for is gauging the personality, the preferences of how they've worked with each other, Are they hustlers? Do they have it in them to start a company? Do they have it in them to pivot? Because a lot of early stage companies pivot. So all of those things. And the last piece is the product. How will I use AI for the product? Depends on what the product is. If it's a software or a tech product, I'm sure we can set up AI tools to test it. To understand the metrics, the user acquisition, what's the MAUD you like? What's the usage frequency, like, etcetera. But if it's consumer product, say, for example, a sunglass, I would have to think of more ways to incorporate AI in the evaluation process.

Could you identify potential challenges or constraints you might face when implementing this AI-driven tool, particularly in evaluating early-stage startups across diverse industries?\n', ""Interviewee: So as I mentioned, one is the biggest piece of the puzzle is the team in early stage investing, and I'm not sure on how we can use AI to analyze the personalities of a person and, like, the behavioral behaviors of a person, their decision making skills, are they hustlers, also the dynamic between the cofounders, think that comes, at least to me, It came after multiple conversations, And getting a knack of how to analyze a founder's thought process. I'm sure we can build an AI around it. But it might take time. So it is a challenge in terms of AI is built on reinforcement learning or structured learning But those learnings are based off of Like, I would say inputs, But sometimes you do not have enough inputs to drive these decisions at a artificial intelligence level. That's one. The second is in terms of market, AI can build on inferences based on existing trends, But a lot of times, early stage investments are based On a trend which is new. So there is no past history or data. To infer from. So I think that could be a limitation When judging startups from an AI perspective. Also, I think biases So already we have a lot of biases So start ups founded by women founders, for example, or people of color. I don't know if there's any bias that is baked into AI models that could let very good opportunity slip out of the gaps. Because of inbuilt biases. You might have heard of the Amazon's AI Resume Screener. That had very strong biases built inbuilt Within So, yeah, something to fight that. \n""], [""Interviewer: Great points you've raised there. What do you think would be the potential benefits or impacts of successfully implementing this AI-driven tool for evaluating early-stage startups?\n"", ""Interviewee: I'm definitely sure it will save a lot of time. So all of that time can be redirected towards basically evaluating more opportunities or working with these startups to actually grow the businesses. So a lot of sourcing and evaluation part of the job converts into portfolio development, operational efficiencies that VC can help bring on the table. That's one I think another benefit is that AI could actually spot trends that humans fail to spot. Definitely, it has been proven. I think AI is 25% better at predicting not 25%, 25 times better at predicting than a human. And less prone to error. So we will definitely be more it could be a scenario where we invest in more profitable or more investable businesses so there are less fallouts from a portfolio for a VC.

We already used tech tools like Affinity to keep a track of sourcing and networking. I think, if I add a layer of AI, we can therefore, the entire piece of analyzing markets and analyzing trends to AI. So I would say that would be the first milestone for me. So if I categorize analyzing any early stage opportunity into market, product, and team, I would defer the market piece to AI, and that would be the first milestone I would work with AI on. In terms of the second milestone, I would think about how can I automate the day to day mundane tasks and defer it to AI? So, as I said, early stage VCs are all about networking. So, basically, knowing about the right deal at the right time and getting into that deal. And getting a bite of it. But for that, we need to do a lot of networking, setting up calls, meeting people. I think a lot of scheduling, calendaring can be 4 2 ai. That already is Done. To a a very large extent. In terms of product, I would also, therefore, I would say like so say, for example, there's a SaaS matrix. You can set up Benchmarks to analyze, okay, is this deal even worth my time? By putting in user base or revenue numbers or churn or what's the repeat Customer intake, etcetera. So all of these things can again be automated and Therefore, to AI in terms of a milestone. Yeah. \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for outlining those steps. Can you discuss potential trade-offs or compromises that might need to be made during the implementation of this AI-driven tool?\n', ""Interviewee: I'm thinking. Sorry. So, I would say compromise would be 1, we might be favoring something that has been proven to be successful in the past, and we are expecting it to be successful in the future as well. So for example, my criteria of team product and market. That criteria might be redefined over time. But AI might still keep rewarding startups that have great team product and market. But there might be a 4th criteria that might just stem up. Say, for example, AI capabilities. And because we have not built that into our learning database, the AI is not inferring from that new criteria that being built. That that could be a compromise. That we might have to sign up for. \n""], ['Interviewer: What do you see as the opportunities for future enhancements or expansions of this AI-driven tool once it is successfully implemented?\n', ""Interviewee: I think the opportunities that I can imagine are more on the synergistic side of things. Right now, VCs operate mostly in silos. When they're evaluating opportunities. So one opportunity is very unique and boxed out from another opportunity. I think AI will be very smart to info from multiple investments of the same VC or of different VCs to infer how we can synergistically Improve business models. So it could be somewhere like, okay. These 2 companies partner where one is a supplier, one is a contractor. Or a client, and they can increase their revenues just by that partnership. But AI would be the first one to infer, okay. This Square peg goes into this square hole. And I think that is an opportunity that humans may not be as fast to leverage as an AI could be. Given they have the right criterias to analyze opportunities. \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those insightful responses. Now, how would you approach integrating this AI tool into the existing workflows at a venture capital firm to ensure minimal disruption and maximum adoption?\n', ""Interviewee: Firstly, I would imagine that every workflow would basically come on one platform. So every stakeholder of the VC interacts with the same platform. Platform. So one, we have everyone on the one on one platform working So right from scheduling meetings, setting up calendar invites to, signing the shareholders agreement. Everything happens on one platform. So one is bringing everyone on the same page. 2nd, in order to not disrupt, the workflow, anything that is going on so AI has access to my meeting notes, to my video interviews, to my Zoom calls with founders. So every data point is still in the same place that I log. But AI has access to it so that it can infer details from it. That's pretty easy, I would say. In terms of analyzing founders, I'm sure there could be base to understand how a person thinks. By giving them case studies or by giving them, by asking more around how they took decisions in their businesses. And we can have AI also coanalyze or copilot with the venture capitalist Okay. Is this a person I think is a hustler or is this a person I can rely on in terms of crisis decision making? So we can, like, copilot the entire process. That is one way to not disrupt any existing workflow, but have AI come in and partner in every step of the way. \n""], ['Interviewer: What metrics or key performance indicators would you monitor to evaluate the success of this AI-driven tool once it has been implemented at a venture capital firm?\n', ""Interviewee: So the KPIs could be as basic as okay, is my analysis and AI's analysis like, how correlated are they? When I talk about analyzing the team? So are my inferences and AI inferences correlating? If there's a high positive correlation, that means the AI is learning how to analyze and evaluate a team. For markets, if the AI is able to spot trends in time, So a KPI could be how accurate the AI is in terms of analyzing and spotting trends. So we can again, so this is a hindsight analysis or KPI. That okay. For the 1st 6 months, the AI analyzes trends For the next 6 months, we see if those are accurate. If they are, that means the AI has actually performed well on that KPI. So that could be one KPI. And the last KPI in terms of product could be how strong is AI crunching numbers? So if the revenue and SaaS matrix, for example, are crunched down by AI, and they can forecast. Okay. This is the forecast for the next year's revenue. And if those forecasts are correct, again, accuracy could be a KPI here.

Can you walk me through a specific example of how you implemented a new system or process that directly led to increased profitability during your time at the Global Legal Law Firm?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Firm? Uh, yes. Uh, thanks for the question. Uh, when I got to this firm, there were about 18 people, and I'll start with one example from in the people area. Uh, the way in which the firm had been doing, uh, recruiting, onboarding, and training performance management. Really, the entire HR process was very basic. And frankly, the the owners of the firm didn't have any time to really focus on it. So I instituted different processes for each stages of that in terms of recruiting, in terms of, uh, the interviewing process. Uh, previously, one partner would interview somebody and the next day the person would show up for work there. Uh, that to me wasn't the best approach. It was I thought it was better to give the candidate an opportunity to see and meet more of the firm and its people, uh, as well as get other people at the firm invested in the success and evaluation of of each candidate. Uh, so we changed that. We grew from 18 to 29 people in, I think, 3 months, maybe 4. That was one thing. There was no performance. I'll just give one more example. Uh, there was there were they were doing good job with 1 on ones on a regular basis, but there were no uh, criteria objective criteria by which people were all being measured. As a result, the paralegals, the attorneys, uh, and the administrative staff didn't know really how they were performing. So when I got to that firm and talked to the employees, one of the biggest things they said was they liked working there, but they really they didn't know how they were doing even though I knew some of them were doing really well from the owner standpoint and some were not doing well. So I instituted a process, uh, by which each different type of employee was measured by in terms of certain competencies and in terms of different activities that they routinely performed a significant amount of time on. Uh, and that process is I think really helping. It actually performance and their, uh, performance the and their their, uh, performance improvement. Thank you.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach to enhancing HR processes and performance management. Shifting focus to the financial side, could you elaborate on how you restructured the firm's financial reporting and budgeting systems to improve transparency and accountability? What specific tools or methodologies did you introduce for this purpose?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: For this purpose. Uh, so there were a couple of things. When I got to the firm, one of the first things I did was I looked at the financials. They were using QuickBooks and, uh, in looking at it, I was looking at their prior year, which had which should have been closed but wasn't. Uh, so I started in late March. Uh, there are calendar year taxpayers. So 3 months had gone by. The 2022 had not yet, uh, the books weren't closed. And in reviewing what was in QuickBooks, it was clear they I understood why they weren't closed. It was very unclear what was going on. Uh, and even by June, I had been there for 2 months and they still weren't closed. There was an external bookkeeper. So one of the things I did, uh, I was the president of the firm, not the controller or the CFO. And as a result, I wasn't going to spend all of my time doing that. That wouldn't have made sense. So I looked into outsourcing this, uh, these processes, and I considered also in sourcing it. And when I was lucky enough to recruit successfully, the CPA for the California Society of CPAs, which I thought of as a great get because I feel like, you know, if you can get the person doing 2 counting for the accounting professionals in California, you probably got the right person. And she was a fantastic fit, uh, and had been with a number of organizations that that, you know, the firm that this firm that we're talking about had when I left 29 people. Uh, she had been at firms with 800 people. So she really knew what she was doing and she was very excited about the opportunity and working with a growing company again. So that was one thing to do just to get the financials right. With respect to some tools and processes I put in place, the firm f it had been around for about 15 years. They never did a budget for the firm, and they never did, uh, case budgets. So I developed a template for the firm's budget, uh, and I also put in place a template and processes for developing budgets, uh, for actual cases or legal matters, uh, so that the firm could look at the ROI of their clients of different types of matters, etcetera. Uh, thank you.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to financial management and the strategic hiring of the CPA is quite insightful. Regarding the development of case budgets and ROI analysis for clients, how did you integrate this data-driven approach into the firm's decision-making processes? Were there any challenges in getting the team to adopt these new methodologies, and if so, how did you address them?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Stem. Great questions. Thank you. Uh, so when you have budgets, you obviously can then look to see how you're performing against them, which we did on a monthly basis, uh, depending on the cases. I mean, this process was just implemented and and we we've so we didn't it was going smoothly. I mean, getting people to adopt, people who had been doing legal work for 10 years, 15 years, who had never done a budget before, those types of people sometimes will feel like, why am I doing this? This is just taking up my time when I could actually be billing for work, which I totally understand. I felt that way as a professional 30 years ago when I started. Um, you know, I was like, well, why do I need a work plan even since I know how to do the work? Why do I have to plan it? Uh, but, obviously, if you're going to work with others, having a work plan and a coordinated approach can be much better. It reduces risk in case you or somebody else on the team isn't available. So like a like a good work plan that's implemented properly, uh, the budget serve to bring the team together, help them with accountability, uh, help us reassess what type of services made sense. Some of the services we're offering, uh, like the firm had been dabbled in collections business for for years on and off. And the the results of this made it clear that that was an area that the firm could pursue, uh, from a financial standpoint, uh, if it wanted to. Like, it made sense to do that from an ROI standpoint based on just the the budgets and the return on investments shown by looking at budget to actuals with respect to just the costs and the return on that particular type of matter. The the biggest pushback really was from 1 of the there were 2 partners who owned the firm, and one of them this is kind of going a little bit of field from the financial angle. But the biggest issue at the firm was one of the attorneys wanted to grow from the 18 people that I came in when they that they had when I came in to 900, uh, attorneys. Uh, whereas his partner, his elder partner who had actually started the firm, uh, was more like, well, why don't I just, you know I would do better if I only had 10 attorneys or 5 attorneys because I can manage that. So I think he had I think he had gone through the, you know, 10 years of trying to manage a a small law firm and wanting to grow, but finding it very challenging to find the right people, uh, especially because as I suggested before, he didn't have the right recruiting process in place, the onboarding processes, the training. There was no training at all done there in a systematic manner. Of course, there was one off training, uh, and there's tons of value in that, but it just isn't this type of efficient and effective investment in the people of the firm to both help with recruiting and make sure you've got your future leaders. So the biggest problem really was getting him, not necessarily on board. He understood the value of it. But to get him to just support a lot of these things because he was more like, why should we grow? I kinda want smaller. And that was those the the 2 guys love each other, uh, but they just have this different sense for where they wanna go. So that was probably the biggest issue. But, uh, but we but it worked out. We he went along with it, and and it's it's working out really well. Thank you.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that the budgeting and ROI analysis not only enhanced financial management but also influenced strategic decisions on firm growth and service offerings. Given your experience in managing such a significant change, how do you approach the measurement of leadership effectiveness, and what metrics or KPIs do you find most valuable in assessing leadership performance within an organization?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Great questions. Uh, and you're very articulate. Thank you. I wish I could answer as articulately as you do. Uh, with respect to measure and leadership, there's different types of leaders. And here I would look at it as it's it's rare to find somebody who's good at everything you need somebody to be good at at in a professional services firm environment or probably in most environments. Uh, And as a result, you you would ideally have a team of leaders, some of whom were really good at certain things and able to focus on those things and then have other people who could take care of, have the time and the expertise and experience to do some of the other things. So the areas that I think of being very important, uh, I'll I'll mention a few. 1 is people. You you need to be able to create the future leaders of the firm and there's a lot to be involved within that. So I'll I'll keep this at a high level and then maybe you'll have some follow-up questions to go into more detail. Uh, so people are very important. Practice development, working on the business and not just in the business, that's very important. So some of the processes we were talking about, some management tools on the finance side. What are the things I did with Global Legal, that law firm we were just talking about, and in my prior it really throughout my career, was developing the tools and processes necessary to make the the day to day work of the employees lower in risk, way more efficient and effective than than not than not having these tools, which I found very common at the the firms that I've been at. They kinda have different people doing different things, which I really support in terms of creativity. But certain things you wanna standardize, uh, and then, of course, listen to your people and change it so that everybody's using what what is collectively and by leadership agreed to be. This is the most efficient and effective way for us to serve our clients, uh, or to win new work or or to track our our metrics. So I would look at in terms of leadership evaluation, I would look at their performance regarding people, regarding the practice. I would look at business development, uh, in including marketing in that thing. And so how prominent in the market are they? So so people practice business development, marketing. You need somebody to be very good at finances, and then you need everybody to understand finances to some extent. So when I was, uh, at a firm called BDO, I had a team of about a 150 people throughout the country in 15 different offices, and we would have monthly calls. Uh, I mean, I had regional leaders, different partners who that I had hired and and, uh, got admitted to the partnership over, you know, after a number of years. Um, and what we would do is make sure that our people understood the financials So they understood that every hour they worked contributed to the financials in this way. So I would review with them every month the national financials so they could see, okay. Here's where we are in terms of revenue. Here's where we are in terms of gross profit, etcetera. Uh, so finances are very important. And then strategy is very important too, of course, uh, which I would and technology is I mean, all of this stuff is important. So I would look to leaders in all of those categories. If I had to pick a financial metric by which to measure somebody, I would pick in a professional services context. I would probably pick gross profit. Uh, it it just depends on your role. Like, as president of a law firm, I needed to look at the net profit, of course. Uh, but if you're a larger firm, oftentimes, like like, take a BDO, I wasn't responsible directly for the insurance premiums where the firm was paying. And that that was affecting net profit, but not gross profit. So measuring me and the hundreds of other partners at at the the firm on the basis of the insurance premiums wouldn't have made sense. So gross profit is probably the financial metric. But, again, just to wrap up, uh, people practice, business development, market prominence, financials, and strategy slash technology. Thank you.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Your approach to evaluating leadership across these key areas is quite comprehensive. Given the emphasis on standardizing processes and leveraging technology for efficiency, how do you balance the need for standardization with the potential for innovation within a firm, especially in the legal and professional services industry where tradition often plays a significant role?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: That's a great that's a fantastic question. And there's always some tension there. But the key here's a quick story when I started and it was 1993. I was still in law school. I did an internship with with a with pricewaterhousecoopers PWC. And the in the project I was assigned to was the first one of its kind under some new law and nobody had developed any procedures. They told me as an intern read the tax code go out and get the information you need and report back and this was like, I was out there for two three months interviewing software Engineers about what they were doing and how it met the legal requirements or didn't meet the legal requirements. And then I had to quantify the extent to which they were performing certain activities or investing certain costs now in certain types of activities and expenses So I put together some tools from my media use so that I didn't have to for example as I'm interviewing all these people. I wanted to have an agenda so I could make sure the person I'm interviewing new out what I want to talk about before the meeting started. I wanted because I need to get information from him or her about the activities they were performing and how they met the various legal test. I just wanted a template for the interviews so I could ask the questions I need to ask. Also, I needed to document their activities on various projects and that was an activity that I thought I could do or I could maybe do with them or they could conceivably do it if they wanted to so that was something I tried. I just let them know. It's like one of the things we need for purposes of this project is we need to get certain information from your brain and in the documentation at the company. into a memo and I'm happy to interview you I mean we can do it together or I mean here's a template you could use if you want to fill it out and then we could talk about it whatever you want to do and and Thankfully really a lot of them wanted to do it on their own on their own time and they would they would fill it out. I would look at it. And then I'd go back to them with questions I would have because that's you know. A lot less than I expected but some of the time of course there was in for you know garbage in garbage out sort of like they didn't quite get the right information I needed but boy that made it way more efficient. So to make this long story short short order. the I put together these tools. I put a number of other tools as well. Just so I could get my job done. I put all this together and then a manager, you know, I was out on my own this whole time and then I go back into the office where I hadn't been it was like my first time in the office since I was headed with this firm and the firm the manager said hey who told you to put these materials together and you sort of bald me out and I was like, oh shoot. I guess I shouldn't have done that all though. I was thinking I don't know. What I mean, how could I not have put this stuff together just seemed like you know, no brainer. So I was like, I didn't know what to think about it a year later. I interned with the firm for a year part-time during the my last year law school when it ended up working their full-time the following year and I got assigned to one of these projects that I had done the first one of with a number of other people, but I was working on my own. And I and they said well, hey we want you to this project. Here's our materials for for us that we're using nationally on these projects and I'm looking through them and I'm like, oh my gosh, these are the materials I put together and and what I learned from that was that you should always make sure to have a culture. All in which everybody at every level has a voice and has you know, it can can make sure that any even complaints. I mean you and you have to encourage that as a leader. It's like look, I want you to complain. I mean ideally you'd complain and then say hey here's an idea of for fixing my complaint. But you know when you hear about a complaint something's not working right and it could be the employee but it could also just be you need your processes slow or maybe you don't even need to do it in the first place. So you have to have a culture in which everybody feels not only like they can tell you what's wrong what they don't like but that's kind of their job their job is to make their job better and easier and your job is to make sure they feel comfortable doing And so I told that story because I really learned from that that even though the my particular manager had kind of told me I shouldn't have done that. I learned a year later that that was actually very beneficial to that firm. And so I wanted to you know, I was like, okay, I've got to make sure everybody you know, I'm not just gonna be like, okay, here's how we're doing it. We're doing this for the next for the rest of our lives. You've got to make sure your people understand that you didn't hire them just toWant them to become you, I mean your job. I used to tell people, you know, if I had to summarize my job and two words. It's to replace myself, especially in the Legal Professional Services context.

And it was very, very difficult to rebrand it in a very, uh, Gen Z way to look because his brand was the brand, the brand logo, the black motto, and everything was very far behind the internet and it taking it to the social media and explaining how social media works and how we can express the brand and bring more customer to the brand by the help of content creation and social media was very difficult. The conversation between the brand and the brand is always been a very difficult part of the job. We have to explain the brand how they have to lose whatever their uh, understanding about the brand is very difficult because they they have been growing this brand in a certain mindset and then being an outsider and explaining and advising them brand, helping more customers, more eyes on the brand is going to be the difficult conversation you ever do, especially when it's a brand working for the government agent. They have specific rules, specific guidelines to follow, and you cannot just make content based on your ideas. You have to understand that the brand is also taking some steps that helps them gain the, uh, numbered customer till now. You cannot affect the change totally. You cannot change the brand totally so that they lose the potential customer they have right now and to attract the future customer. So this conversation has always been the very difficult one, but I, uh, from my skills what I have understood because I worked in this place in a for a very long time that the conversations should be just not putting the changes into them, but also understanding what the brand has been doing for last few years or since it has started.

And to keep up with the trends, this few categories are very difficult to maintain as a digital marketer. So I take help of few tools like Semrush and, uh, Google Trends, Google Console to understand what the markings are going on with the website. I help take help of the content creation, like write writing down the content. I do all the content myself because understanding of the website, the customer they are looking, and I will change every day, like, sorry, change the content every week to understand which content is getting more views, which content it's, attraction and how to, uh, how it will be upgrading the content more and more, and especially with the help of different people in the team. I always go back to the website designer, I always go back to the people who has worked before. And with the help of them, we create a very good narration to the brand. We help to create the content aligned with the keywords, aligned with the train trends, and, uh, it help us to distinguish be between being jargon in the website and being unique in the website. We don't want to be like the same brand, every brand is talking about, uh, innovation, technology, and how AI is helping us. We want to be a different voice. So these things help us to understand how we are taking a stand as of being a very particular voice through this content creation rather than being, uh, repetitive and jargon and almost the same as the other brand or the next person. So SEO becomes a very great, uh, tool for us to understand where the trends are going on, how to follow the trends, and when to differentiate from the trends, and how to rank as a very unique voice in the website or in the Internet and how to attract more customers or more reader or maybe more, uh, followers through this being different from other. Um, one of the greatest achievements that we have been doing through keywords is for one of the client who was a media in the media industry from the media industry.

So it's very different and very important to understand where to stand, how to stand, which trends to follow, which trends to ignore, and how to be a unique voice in this entire thing.

They were integrated before now try time movies came to me and they explained that how they want to be different from their viewers in us and focus on Indian viewers and the most difficult part was they already had the fan base which was particularly in US particularly focusing on the US region and they were collaborating with different media company which was situated in us and then focusing on India within a month was a very difficult and very challenging work. So I asked them that if I can get the data of their viewers. Have been catering for all this years and I could review what are the probability that they could have a greater or seen maybe not less but greater or same approach was India and Bangladesh. One of the difficult point was to explain them that how you us we use customer new content differently than Indian customers the every eval. Mission every understanding of the data was purely dependent upon Indian Society rather than in US Society there. They have to shift the entire content Creation in accordingly to the Indian Society rather than how they were making in us. So the so the understanding of the data was what the four key features that I came up with the data focusing on issues like us issues US immigration unemployment should be shifting to more traditional ways of India issues. For example, working on religious attributes working on how normal human being in India suffer from traffic and laws your or the Discrimination or the gender bias shifting that is Shifting views second is to portrayal of Indian in the market there. Content previously was based on us. They were us places. They were us workers or actors acting on so we have to totally change the place and actors into the Indian word second. The war language is they can shoot they shot using so that the Indians should understand that this content is catering to them doesn't have to be all the vernacular language at the first word. It's very interesting if you use Hindi and Order and Tamil Nadu. Sorry Tamil into that because more of the people will attracted to the vernacular languages. Second include infusing religion or rituals or maybe some important segment from Indian background or traditional or culture because that's how people are drawn towards that so I went back and researched in different type of contents produced in India for catering for Indian customers only such as the Royal stag shorts films and there were some contents created by YouTube. Content created in YouTube by YouTube users and I went back and analyzed the four components that I talked about was different from the my clients. We went back to the content. We recreated every script we understood how to implement the Indians of the world in the program and then we came back and we started working on the continent this analysis of the data different from US market to Indian market was very very important for all of us me and the brand to understand where we are going with the content. If we if we haven't done this if we haven't made the important changes his idea of coming to India being a Us Creature coming to Indian catering to Indian Community or society would be a failure. So understanding this data and analyzing what are the things that he needs to implement? What are the things he needs to this cut from his cut or deduct from his content was very essential and I think I did a pretty good job becauseIt was a one project and we could only do this much in this little bit of time and the client was very happy. We were very happy with the results.\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to adapting content for a new demographic by deeply analyzing viewer data and cultural preferences showcases a sophisticated understanding of data analysis in digital marketing. Given your expertise in SMM marketing, could you share how you've leveraged social media metrics and analytics to refine a campaign? Specifically, what metrics did you prioritize, and how did those insights lead to adjustments in your strategy? \n"", 'Interviewee: So I will talk about a work I did with Yuma. Uh, she is, uh, she is running an agency in UK. She has a lot of brands, uh, she works with. And the most difficult part of her of her creating content was, especially in social media marketing, that she did not understand how to cater all the brands and still keep her voice different. Uh, let me be a little more explanatory in this section. It sounds like you were\n'], [""Interviewer: It sounds like you were tasked with a complex challenge of maintaining a unique voice while managing multiple brands. In tackling this, what specific social media metrics did you focus on to ensure each brand's content resonated with its target audience, and how did you use these metrics to adjust your strategies? \n"", ""Interviewee: So we focus on the work. Mostly for example, if the company or the brand is selling curds and hair product we focus on mostly on the customers that are working towards the hair product and looking towards the hair product for example graduates or Google form. These are the places where people started questioning few things like my hair is falling out and my things I cannot take care of my hair. So we were starting targeting this product specific product to specific customer. We started working on different Google forms and started Distributing to understand. What are the customer we should be targeting most for which brand if I'm selling let's sick and I started targeting men that will be totally not a great campaign. So we started celebrate Distributing more and more Google forms. We started creating more questioning in the Instagram with the polls and everything to explain to understand what our customer wants. One of the biggest question biggest campaign we have done till now for calls and length is that we started tiktok video. The client posted the tiktok video with the pool to understand. What is the next product the customer want to understand? The customer voice is the greatest part of the brand Innovation. If you don't understand the customer voice the brand will not really understand to the customer accordingly. So we started the poll we I started reaching to customers through DMs and we started answering the question in the comments. We let a campaign called ask me anything about the hair or it was something like that. We came out of better tagline. I promise I don't remember right away and this started questioning us and we started posting that online whatever the question that we're having and they started answering them. We started releasing whatever the orders we had. We started releasing elected with them that if you have any issues or any problems, or you want to find a new product, please comment down in a social media and as a manager, I understood the brand what they are working with what the helping with what they are targeting and I started replying to them. I started managing the comments and started making a Excel sheet out of it the problem how we can resolve it. What are the answer that I give to the problem? What are we can promise and how we can answer them so brand has this loyalty with the customer and the customer had the Loyalty with the brand this conversation is very important right now in social media because now when you can touch the brand the brand is somewhere else the customer somebody somewhere else social media is a place or the platform that connects the brand with the customer and having a very lucid conversation or maybe even trying to make a conversation with the customer makes a lawyer Blaze and it helps the brand to grow further being a loyal customer. So go further and have customer and the customer to be believed that the brand is not just to make money out of them but also to sell and product that will benefit them and it's legit because there are so many websites so many Brands popping up here and there and you being a unique voice is this is how you can you make be a unique voice and this is how your social media manager can help you understand your customer and help you understand how you will be different and unique in this because social media platform is one platform where the brand meets the customer and the customer meets the brand and this management is very important and very necessary for any brand to have a particular conversation particular understanding between their customer or their is no where else they cannot communicate or connect with the customer and know the feedback. This is the best way they can do and I think the social media manager has a very very important role in to this.\n""], ['Interviewer: Thanks for taking the time to interview with us!

Yes.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: Great! I see from your resume that you've had extensive experience with marketing operations, particularly in optimizing automation platforms and implementing ABM strategies. Can you walk me through a specific instance where you integrated Salesforce with HubSpot at PlainID, and the challenges you had to overcome?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Um, so I joined Plan ID, and they had a HubSpot and Salesforce set up. There was a sales ops person who had set it up. Um, but I noticed when I was auditing the system that there was a lot of sync errors between HubSpot and Salesforce. Um, and there was a lot of duplicates. Um, so I went through and eliminated all of the sync errors and, uh, eliminated all of the duplicates. I made sure that the leads were flowing through the systems from, uh, our website and our offline campaigns, um, all the way through HubSpot to Salesforce. And, uh, I made sure that the, um, you know, lead tracking was set up properly and leads were getting added to campaigns properly so that we could do multi touch attribution. Yeah. So I would say probably, like, 60 to 70% of leads we're getting through, um, when we were doing offline campaigns, um, before I joined. And, um, you know, I meticulously went through each campaign, um, as we uploaded the leads into the system and make sure that they weren't getting any sync errors so that they could be properly added to Salesforce campaigns. So that, yeah, we could track our marketing results.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a significant improvement in lead tracking and campaign attribution. When you were resolving the sync errors and deduplicating the data, what specific strategies or tools did you use to ensure a smooth integration and data cleanliness between HubSpot and Salesforce?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Um, a combination of the dedupe, um, wizard with HubSpot as well as a marketplace software solution that allows you to do bulk deduplication, um, using HubSpot. Um, we had lean data set up on the Salesforce side to do deduplication. Uh, so the problem was in HubSpot, um, when you uploaded a lead that was a duplicate lead in Salesforce. And it wasn't, um, syncing properly. Um, you had to figure out why it wasn't syncing properly, um, using the audit tools in HubSpot. And then, uh, fix those errors so that they could sync. And then you could, um, merge them or dedupe them.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Interesting approach with the combination of tools. Shifting focus to your work with Full Circle Insights for multi-touch attribution, could you explain how you configured Full Circle Insights within the existing Salesforce and HubSpot setup to track the customer journey more effectively?  \n\n', 'Interviewee: Yeah. We set up 3 models, um, with full circle insights so that we could do multi touch attribution reporting in Salesforce. Um, we used a first touch, last touch, and a multi touch model. And that was, uh, so that we could build reports and dashboards based on these models. Um, we had a multi touch attribution reporting dashboard, um, that allowed you to see, uh, you know, lead first touch, contact first touch, MQL first touch, opportunity first touch, and then, of course, um, you know, the last touch for each one and multi touch for each one. This was really helpful in identifying which campaigns were performing well. We also, um, upgraded our full circle insights instance so that we could include digital touches. And we were implementing that towards the end of my tenure at plan ID.\n\n'], ['Interviewer: The use of different attribution models is quite insightful. When you upgraded to include digital touches, what were the key challenges you faced in capturing and attributing those touches accurately, especially considering the integration with HubSpot for online engagements?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. Um, some of it was budget constraints and, um, building a business case for it. Some of it was implementation time, um, working with Full Circle. They, uh, helped us implement a AWS or not. I think it was Google Cloud, um, instance so that we could track anonymous, um, users data and then, um, setting up the reporting and campaign automation in Salesforce using their their, um, object tool. So, um, we could track, you know, all of the, um, digital touch points that came in, especially from anonymous visitors. Um, this was all mostly done in Salesforce. Um, so, uh, the HubSpot integration did not exist. It does not exist, um, for full circle insights. But this allowed us to track, you know, the first touch. Uh, somebody comes in from a LinkedIn ad or a, um, Google ad or something like that. If they don't fill out a form, they remain anonymous. Um, so but, you know, if a, you know, a year goes by or something like that, and then they um, fill out a form on our website, we can track that, um, data all the way back to when they first, uh, hit our website from, uh, Google Ad, for example. Um, and that is all done with the full circle digital touch product that they have, I can't remember what it's called.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: The implementation of Full Circle's digital touch product sounds quite complex yet impactful. Given the limitations with HubSpot's integration in this context, how do you envision enhancing the integration between HubSpot and Full Circle (or similar attribution tools) to streamline the process of tracking and attributing online engagements more effectively?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Um, we're we're using HubSpot for our lead source data. So if somebody comes in, um, there's an original source tracking process in HubSpot that allows us to, um, fill out our, uh, lead source field, um, that is synced to Salesforce. And we have workflow set up to automatically assign those lead sources. Uh, so, you know, if somebody comes in from uh, organic LinkedIn, um, we'll know that. Um, we're also using tracking URLs on everything. So I implemented that when I was there to make sure that, you know, all of our organic social traffic is getting tracked, um, properly, and all of our organic search traffic and all of our offline campaigns and stuff like that. As far as making sure that HubSpot and Full Circle are working together, I don't see an integration right now. Um, that's why we're using FullCircle's digital touch points, um, product, um, to do that use with their campaign attribution tool. Um, that was sort of a necessary piece of the tech stack that we needed, um, if we wanted to do attribution reporting with full circle, um, inside Salesforce.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Your approach to leveraging HubSpot's lead source data for initial attribution is quite strategic. Considering the reliance on Salesforce for detailed attribution through Full Circle, how do you ensure data consistency and accuracy between HubSpot and Salesforce, especially with the ongoing campaigns and lead nurturing activities?  \n\n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. Um, the sync errors were removed, like I said, from, uh, when I started. Um, and then ongoing maintenance of those sync errors, uh, is important. And then making sure that our fields are synced, um, to Hubs or from HubSpot to Salesforce properly. Uh, so, like, lead source information, tracking information, conversion information, um, is is synced properly and the leads are syncing properly. Um, that is sort of how I was maintaining it. And then making sure that, uh, you know, the proper leads are getting added to campaigns and auditing and maintaining the sync issues between HubSpot and Salesforce. Um, I also set up a custom object in HubSpot for Salesforce campaigns to sync, um, back to HubSpot so that we could see you know, make a list of, um, those that were added to a Salesforce campaign and the, um, campaign statuses that allowed us to, um, build out, uh, you know, on nurturing campaigns and lead lists and and things like that based on Salesforce campaigns. We did a lot of events, uh, and offline marketing using Salesforce. And so that data was mainly, uh, set up and maintained in Salesforce. And so the the, um, project there was to make sure that we were getting, uh, that information back into HubSpot, um, as best as we could.\n\n'], [""Interviewer: The ongoing maintenance and sync process you've described are crucial for ensuring data integrity. Shifting focus a bit, let's talk about your experience with the Demandbase and 6sense ABM platforms. Can you compare the implementation and use of these two platforms in terms of their integration with your existing systems, particularly HubSpot and Salesforce?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yes. So 6¢, uh, basically requires you to have Salesforce. It works with their, um, you know, accounts in Salesforce. Um, one of the problems that you run into with 6 Sense, HubSpot, and Salesforce is, uh, accounts don't sync, um, from HubSpot to Salesforce. Um, there's a lot of duplicates that are created. And so it's important to maintain, uh, you know, your duplicates in HubSpot, um, when it comes to account based marketing. There's a lot of them usually at the beginning. What I found is that you can build a list of accounts that hadn't synced, um, since you had deduped, and then you can just remove them because there's no way to merge accounts right now with HubSpot. So that was, uh, you know, part of the process of keeping data up to date, uh, with 6 Sense, Salesforce, and HubSpot. Demand based, uh, again, we had to work with domain based to make sure that we weren't creating duplicates. At first, when we set up the system, it was creating duplicates, um, in their end, and then, um, it would create syncing issues with our account scoring and lead scoring, um, from demand based, um, to Salesforce. And so we had to work with them to make sure that that was set up properly and that we weren't creating duplicates in demand base. The there is no integration with 6¢ or Demandbase and HubSpot, but there is integrations with, um, Demandbase and Salesforce. Um, so if you make sure that, um, your data is is flowing properly, there are no duplicates, and there are no sync errors between Demandbase and HubSpot and Salesforce, um, then typically you have, uh, you know, good clean data.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: Managing account and data integrity is indeed crucial for ABM platforms like 6sense and Demandbase. Given the challenges you've faced with account syncing and data cleanliness, what strategies or tools have you found most effective in maintaining clean and synced account data across HubSpot, Salesforce, and these ABM platforms?  \n\n"", ""Interviewee: So we're using Salesforce and Demandbase. I'll talk about that. Uh, we did. That would it would create an account in demand base and then sync it to Salesforce, um, using, uh, you know, the duplicate algorithm based on the account name, address, and phone number, um, I believe. And we were using Salesforce as our source of truth. And so, uh, uh, if an account was in Salesforce and, um, we could sync it to demand base and, um, all was good. Sometimes accounts would come in from demand base, um, that works in Salesforce. And so we would have to make sure that the account was created in, um, Salesforce. And then, uh, it would, um, sync back to demand base, and then we could do our lead scoring.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Using Salesforce as the source of truth for account data and leveraging the syncing process with Demandbase for account creation and management is a solid approach. How about with 6sense and HubSpot? Given the limitations on direct integration, how do you ensure that the data and insights from 6sense are effectively utilized in your HubSpot workflows, especially in terms of identifying and engaging with high-value accounts?  \n\n', 'Interviewee: Can you repeat the question?\n\n'], ['Interviewer: Certainly. With the limitations on direct integration between 6sense and HubSpot, how do you currently ensure that the data and insights from 6sense, especially regarding account engagement and intent, are effectively utilized in your HubSpot workflows to target and engage high-value accounts?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Um, so we had all the fields mapped from sixth sense to HubSpot account and and leads. So if there was like an intense score or a qualification score on the account that would come in from six cents and we use that intent data to feed into HubSpot. And then we could do lead scoring in HubSpot. If we wanted to or you could use sixth senses your main lead scoring tool. and as far as accounts coming into sixth sense they would sink between the two based on. The Domain in HubSpot, and so if the domain was the same in sixth sense as HubSpot and those accounts with sink there was there wasn't a lot of sink errors as far as I remember. It's been a little while now.

Given this setup, what specific metrics or outcomes have you tracked to measure the effectiveness of this integration in terms of lead quality, engagement, or conversion rates?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: um, we increase accounting engagement by You know quite a bit. It's been a while since I've looked at the data, but you know when you set up a system, it goes from 0 to you know. 100% pretty quick but the intent data coming from Sixth Sense allowed us to hone our marketing and sales efforts on accounts that were heating up and then we could trigger, you know, workflows and and nurturing campaigns and Target. SDR Outreach emails account base marketing tactics, you know. From HubSpot or yeah from HubSpot. And sales loft or Outreach depending on which tools you're using.

In evaluating the effectiveness of these targeted efforts, what methods or tools have you used to attribute engagement and conversions back to the specific campaigns or initiatives that were driven by 6sense data through HubSpot?  \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. We're looking at, um, account engagement scores. Um, and, you know, are they increasing month to month, quarter to quarter? Especially at our target accounts, you know, so you can pull a report in 6¢ to see how those accounts are engaging and, um, which accounts are engaging, which ones are increasing. So we pulled those reports. Um, and then we also looked at our conversion rates, uh, from, you know, our ABM display campaigns, um, and to see, you know, are they are they improving over time?

What were the key challenges you faced and how did you overcome them? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Well, when I was working for a start up called Aventura, I used business intelligence, to create the sales structure, how business intelligence Well, we we needed to to look and to search, little of data So I used some tools to, develop a system where we create a pipeline pipe, yeah, pipe drive where we have pipelines. That structure help us to create basically the go to market plan where we qualify with all this information and and if you need and clean this cleaning this information. With, with, forgot to go to market plan. Sorry. And having this this go to market plan, we can reach, this up okay. This app and, well, all the project, right, of Aventuraza. At this at at the same time, I needed to control all of the workflows for this project because, basically, I was the leader, but I have people, searching, for the information for my prospects of future clients. So I most control every aspect of, the tasks, and I I break task I kind of did a sprint, so I did a mixture between, between, some methodologies of project management So we create a backlog, we did springs, where at the end of the day, we needed control. So using Asana, we have this project manager control. Project management control. So that is why I can consider that business intelligence to create the business and project manager to project management to, control all the tasks to be on time with the project, and that's it.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: That's a comprehensive approach to integrating business intelligence and project management. Can you elaborate on the specific business intelligence tools you used to develop the pipeline structure in Pipedrive? Additionally, how did you measure the effectiveness of this integrated system in terms of sales performance and project delivery? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Okay. So, basically, as we were in a start up and we have no money, all the all the tools that we use to clean up the data, to qualify data, and yes, basically, to have a nice set of data. Was, made by Google Sheets. Right? It was with let's say, that it was, like, we were creating our ideal software Right? But with the resources that we had, not spending money, being ingenious, to create this, tool but using mainly spreadsheets from Google. That that was it, how how how we did it. And you repeat the second question, please?\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's impressive how you leveraged Google Sheets for such a critical aspect of your project. My second question was about how you measured the effectiveness of this integrated system. Specifically, what key performance indicators (KPIs) did you track to ensure that the pipeline structure and project management approach were driving sales and project completion in the desired direction? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: Yeah. Certainly. So, basically, with this Google Sheet solution that we created. I created as well a dashboard. Right? This dashboard can be able to measure all the activities for 2 departments. The first one was for sales, and the second one was account manager. Right? Because I was in charge of both departments. So area. Sorry. So, basically, for sales, I created this dashboard, as we were in an earlier stage of launching and of the go to market plan. I used to measure everything. From, number of calls, number of effective calls, number of approaches during the day, during the week, during the month. So the first KPI that I created well, that I used was number of calls versus effective calls just to have a rate. Right? Or effective effectiveness effectiveness rate. Of our calls. And having that, we start creating a an an improving and and our features start improving and evolving to have a a a better approach. Right? Because we were doing that in all the processing, cold calling or with with one call, 2 calls, 3 calls, when the prospect accepted. And we sync when we when sign up. So, basically, I I use it like that. To measure that and with account manager was account management was almost the same, but the KPI was okay. So, I used to met I I used to my metric my main metric was how many calls are you receiving, how many calls are finding a solution? So let's say so receive calls against solutions made. So those were my basic metrics during that project in Alenduriza's start. That's it.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: The way you defined and tracked KPIs for both sales and account management is quite insightful. Shifting focus a bit to your experience with project management methodologies, you mentioned using a mix of methodologies. Can you elaborate on the specific aspects of both PMI and Scrum that you found most valuable in the context of your project at Aventura? How did you tailor these methodologies to suit the startup environment and the nature of your projects? \n\n', ""Interviewee: So, basically, I needed to make a make sure because, as I told you, the resources were not as big as we wanted. The money resources and obviously the human resource. Right? So I was in charge of 2 areas, but my stakeholders were, for instance, the project management area. And, development team were were my stakeholders. And as I was talking to the prospects and clients, I must gave that information, that feedback, and that insights to them. So in Aventura, we created this material methodology. We had, some aspects from scrum, to break tasks. Right? We have a a backlog, We have from the PM, PMP methodology, we have briefs. Why? Because we wanted all to understand the basic concepts So we have this brief of every, project that we needed to be, working with. As as as a unit, as a business unit, not not not as, different or independent business units. And we we, as as I was involved with, a developer development process, I needed to understand how was the sprints the the waterfall methodology. So basically, we took several, elements as you can as you can hear. From different methodologies to create our own, and we add a that to, Asana that was the tool that we were used to to to to that that we use. Sorry. And as well, the communication is very important in those stages early stages So we use, for that Slack. We use Envision. Well, Slack for the communication, and, you know, we can open threads and we can go directly depending on the topic to give some, follow ups. We we use as well Invisio to get to see the dummies or of of the app. Right? How, how it it it it, how was, evolving the the deliveries from every model model of the app. And, last but not least, we, used to to I don't remember in this moment the name of the tool, for that but that tool was work for workflows. Because that was so important for us. Just take a look through the workflows and try to understand that and look for improvements. On those workloads. But I be honest, I can't remember the name of of that tool. I can look for it right now, but, or after the interview, and I can give you guys a follow-up. About that, too. That's it.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: The way you combined elements from different methodologies to suit your specific needs at Aventura is quite innovative. Given your experience with these methodologies and the tools you mentioned, how did you ensure that the project team remained aligned and focused on the project's goals, especially with the dynamic nature of a startup environment? What were some of the key communication and collaboration strategies you found most effective in this context? \n\n"", ""Interviewee: You just said it. The communication is basic and essential for the success of a project. And, understanding as well the backgrounds of every member of the teams is important. Right? Empowering the decisions be clear on the tasks, and be clear on the concepts. That is why for me, the best tool and in my experience, the tool that always help that with with that, it's having a brief of the project a clear, concise brief, where we, in the first two sheets, we, understand what is the objective of the of the task or or even the project. We understand that, how how far we want to go with it. What are the resources we want to know, having a a timeline. It's so important always. To this brief to consider to consider that, to have a timeline. And last but not but not least, perhaps the this could be the the first the first point of this. The most important is aligning the concepts. Right? Because for some person,\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given the critical role of clear communication and alignment on project goals, how did you handle situations where team members had differing interpretations of the project brief or objectives? Can you describe a specific instance where this misalignment occurred and the steps you took to realign the team and ensure everyone was on the same page? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Aligning the concepts. I mean, in the brief, just having, like, a glossary of of aligning the concepts that would be that would do it in my experience. And, the most of the times when I found this, misalignment was when we get somebody new into the team or when a leader just said, okay. So you know what? I don't have time for this, so my right hand is going to with this. That's one that's another thing. You know? Leaders need to be involved. As far as they can, as far as they can understand or with the time that's far as they can because of the times. But they're we need always a person of every area to be involved all the time with the project and reporting to those superiors. Otherwise, the communication, it's going to be a problem.\n\n""], [""Interviewer: It's clear that involving key stakeholders and maintaining consistent communication channels are crucial for project success.

What was the outcome of that decision? \n\n"", 'Interviewee: Yeah. When when as I mentioned, I created a go to market plan for this startup.

We obtain the data from social network and from cold calling. So we have direct access to the this data because we, we check that data with the person that we're creating the businesses. Right? So for me, it was so important just to have this data clear this data updated. And as having that, we qualify the prospects We gave them a number depending on the data that we obtained, free surprises, locations, services, and different data. Right? If They got social network and all the tools that we use were we're maintaining or or were developed by my sales crew because they were researching everything. In these early stages, for me, it's so difficult just to put, an an AI to understand the data because as we were creating this startup, first of all, I want to to understand all the data, the market, and the trends. And afterwards, perhaps use another, AI, to help me, creating dashboards or predicting some trends with the historical information. That's for me my answer.\n\n""], ['Interviewer: Given the reliance on manual data collection and analysis in the early stages of your startup, how do you envision the integration of AI or machine learning technologies to enhance your data analysis processes in the future? Can you provide some insights into the specific aspects of data analysis or decision-making that you believe AI could significantly improve within your sales and project management workflows? \n\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. I mean, in my go to market plan, I definitely organize, and and I I have a a a visualization. Of having an AI or customer service, even for sales. You know? It it it is important. How am I going to do that? Just comprehending the data or showing to the intelligence how to talk to the clients, how programming the tone of the company and, trying to teach the intelligence how to make sales upsells and define if, some, client needed needs depending on historical information, obviously. Need a new solution or just to strong I mean, not strong. Needed to verify the actual solution that you're using. So that is why, I I really think that artificial intelligence will help us to do that for salespeople, and we will have more and more and more time to deal with another, another daily basis problems.

For the first question, I found that the most difficult portion of that project was needing to be able to actually get alignment from a bunch of different teams. So there was the development team that was handling the front end. So we were working on AEM. In that regard. The back end team that was actually working with the commerce system, which was Magento at the time, There was a concurrent services implementation, so there was so for service cloud that was being implemented as well as a microservice team that was working with kind of microservices that needed to be built up, and MuleSoft was handling the integration between all of those different systems, and that was in the middle of of a transition as well. So for my role, it was required that I had quite a bit of input in terms of being able to make sure that all of those teams were aligned in terms of features that needed to be built. So I was quite client facing in that regard. But then making sure that all of the requirements and all of the build was was working concurrently because all of the teams effectively had to move in lockstep. Regarding the second question, with the Team for the connector company. That one was difficult because it actually was a project that started in the February of 2020 before COVID hit. Then it lit up. Being scoped to, to do the same delivery over the same period of time. During the March of 2020 lockdowns. That was a bit difficult because, again, it was a global rollout. So we had our initial meetings where the team from Europe was actually there on Thursday, then by Friday, they all had to fly back. So we had to finish up our our kickoff without the European team. The Asian team was was not allowed to travel at all because of some of the mandates, and so we ended up being completely remote. And just being able to ask questions as quickly as we had initially as we had initially thought ended up being a little bit more difficult. With that one, it was a Commerce Cloud integration. MuleSoft as well as as well as or implementation rather, as well as Services Cloud. And because it was a company that had a lot of international clients, they had quite a bit of Quite a few mandates that we needed to keep up with on an international basis. Things like conflict minerals or or hazardous materials, So the number of case types that they were using was was quite large. As far as what we actually needed to account for. And so the workflows of all those different case types ended up adding to the complexity of that role. I believe the third question was related to my research experience when I was looking at companies in the APAC region. So a big part about this, what I noticed when it came time to speaking to startups was actually having a chance to Speak directly to the individuals that were on the ground. Given that our VP is a growth stage firm, a big part of what we actually were doing, we're trying to identify who the earlier stage firms were in the area. That would have a better visibility and kind of the ability to play closer to the net Then we would. Given that companies had to hit specific metrics before they became of interest, but being able to build those relationships from the beginning was huge. So I spent quite a bit of time on LinkedIn. I was doing a lot of cold prospecting I started relatively close. So the firms that I had had an opportunity to work with, I would go and speak to those individuals and ask if they knew investors that were in the area. So through those types of those types of introductions, I was then able to get quite a bit of a build up quite a bit of a network for individuals who are in that space So that the cold emailing combined with kind of expanding the current network allowed me to get a decent amount of input from both founders and investors that were in the space and actually still keep in touch with a few of them today. So that's been a really helpful growth experience. The next question asked about the the Capital IQ pitch book, and pitch book, tools and affinity that I've used. So I've actually found helpful. I use it the most frequently. And that's actually been really helpful for all types of of different experiences. I think one of the biggest ones was when I was actually in school. I used quite a bit because it allowed me to go and identify individuals and find out how to get in contact with them. A big part of what I was doing when I was there, I was the president of our entrepreneurship and venture capital club, so I needed to be able to source speakers. And being able identify people's names and then get their email addresses based off of Facebook information was really helpful. With Capital IQ, I found that it was actually the most helpful when I needed to do diligence for comps in terms of what I would be able to use as far as best case scenarios. If you will, for for outcomes. So being able to get the the data from public companies as far as what rounds were they trading at, what were the multiples as far as what the revenue to, valuation multiple would be at each respective realm so we could get a little bit of visibility into what it would look like all the way up until an IPO for a for an early stage company that we're looking at. Just kinda compare that to what the the current outcome was with with a company that had already kind of seen that success within a similar sector. In the same space. I believe those were all the questions. \n""], [""Interviewer: Thank you for the detailed responses. Let's dive into a case study scenario relevant to your experience. Imagine you are tasked with leading a project to integrate an e-commerce platform with a CRM system for a global electronics manufacturer. The systems involved include Salesforce Commerce Cloud, MuleSoft for integration, and a customer data platform. How would you approach designing the solution architecture for this integration? What potential challenges or constraints do you foresee in executing this project successfully?\n"", ""Interviewee: So as far as the design is concerned, I've never actually been on this solution architecture side. Most of what I under or most of what I worked with rather was really understanding the way that the business worked and then seeing how the system would effectively be able to extend to handle what they, what they were already working with and what the to b process could be like. Given what was just described, the MuleSoft team integration team would actually have to be involved in every single aspect. Given that MuleSoft is native to Salesforce. That is a little bit more helpful, but the fact that there's a Commerce Cloud portion as well as a customer data management system, there would be some need to make sure there would be a need rather to make sure that the data mapping is is really critical. So from the commerce perspective, I think that let's start with understanding exactly the the end state needs to look like, what the customer's experience actually needs to be within that commerce section. I think there's a difference between b to c commerce and b to b commerce. Far as what that experience typically looks like or has looked like in terms of the the projects that I've been a part of. And so making sure that that is very clear and making sure that the business is is involved in that from the beginning, I think, would be paramount. To that point, I would also make sure that the integration team is along for the ride. Because I found that what actually usually happens is when the integration team doesn't have good visibility into what the end process needs to actually look like, not only can they not suggest the best way to go about handling the integrations They actually need to be taught kind of a second time. Basically, what all the systems would be doing because they sit in the middle and they wouldn't have access to to the endpoints in terms of the beginning and the end. As far as the data management system, That would be more or less static in terms of the way that it has already been built. And so I would say that just a very, very good base level of understanding is, is the way that that needs to go. I think that in terms of actually getting the team together, there needs to be a champion from that side because typically, I found that those types of systems are run by 1 or 2 individuals who just have all of the information. And, being able to being able to proceed without them isn't really something that I've seen done successfully. So making sure that they are involved from the beginning all the way through the entire process would be paramount. And that that's more or less how we design it. In terms of challenges, I think the schedules would line up. I think what I've laid out are quite a few dependencies you know, the MuleSoft team or the integration team needing to get a lot of visibility from both the business side business side needing to understand where exactly that data is coming from, what form it's coming from to make sure that the mapping takes place, and then being able to explain that experience well And with these dependencies, what ends up happening is iteration actually ends up moving a little bit more slowly from what I've experienced. So if the experience for the customer the end customer, is not very, very clearly laid out or understood, in the beginning, which tends to be the case with some of the clients that I've had. Then a big portion of what we actually spent our time on was really iterating and trying to make changes on the fly. As far as challenges, this one is not necessarily one that The integration team would be dealing with, but I've had a bit of experience with this one as well where the way that the project is sold, the commercial side then begins to have implications as far as how the actual work is being done. So say for instance, it's something like a fixed bid versus the time of materials, if the amount of money that has already been spent on the project is more or less fixed and things like chain orders have to come into play, it really just messes with the speed of of execution and delivery there, and, and then it starts to get a little bit contentious because each side has their own their own things that they're trying to to vie for. So the incentives get a little bit misaligned. So I feel like that would be of the challenges is to make sure that it sound both on the dependency side, but also on the commercial side of the project. \n""], ['Interviewer: Great insights on the solution architecture and challenges. What would be the key steps or milestones in implementing this integration project from start to finish? How would you prioritize these steps to ensure a smooth execution?\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So as far as key steps, I would say the initial phases where it's actually being sold are huge because it needs to be scoped correctly. Being able to understand what personnel is actually required as far as what the timelines would look like and what the actual work that needs to be completed Would be excuse me, Would be paramount. So that would say I would say that would definitely be the first phase Once all of that has been decided and there's a good method of working that has actually been established, The next step, I think, would then be kind of the blueprinting. So really getting somebody who has a good functional and business skills to partner with someone who has very sound technical skills on the implementation team. To go in and take a look at what already exists there. This was a big part of what I used to have to do where I would go in and really just get a good understanding of how the business actually functioned, kind of in the as is. So the 2 b section and the 2 b way that things would be handled you could take a little bit of time as you're figuring it out, but really, really sound understanding of what all actually exists within the current day process and what all the actual workers within the company are doing is is really, really required. So I would say that that blueprint phase that needs to be kind of accounted for needs to be thought of really well and really soundly. The reason why is because now you want to start to establish some level of expertise on your own team. So there needs to be an individual who has a good enough understanding of the business where there will still be questions. They can build up rapport with the customer and all of that. But big portion of their job now is to effectively act as the quote unquote wealth of knowledge within that implementation team. So for questions that exist, they would be coming to somebody who's in that role. They would effectively be, like, a kind of a functional lead in that capacity. And it really helps if you are coupled with somebody who has that level of technical expertise because then they can expect they can give they can set expectations rather as far as letting individuals know what is possible. \n""], ['Interviewer: In terms of potential trade-offs or compromises that may be needed during this e-commerce and CRM integration, what are some that you foresee? How would you manage these trade-offs to maintain project momentum?\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So a good example of a trade off that I've actually seen in real time is the difference between potentially having live updates versus something like batch updates. And so this would be a good example of a trade off in terms of because it will really come down to what the customer experience needs to be And Really, what product it is that you're selling that needs to kinda hinge on that customer experience. An example is for a larger b to b connector company, they could afford to do batch updates that only updated every hours. It wouldn't get in the way of their business because these are larger enterprises that are expecting these connectors and cables and electronic parts. They could afford to have their inventory updated on a daily basis And if they actually if their inventory management system wasn't 100% up to date, that would be fine because a lot of what they had at actually established were, for enterprise level contracts. And so being able to go and build to capacity wasn't an issue at all. A second example where that trade off would be would need to be a live update as far as something like inventory or being able to make sure the customer experience, they have a really, really granular view of what's actually taking place is when I was working with a firm that was doing wireless glucose monitors. That is something that is, a, it's a health care item. So individuals' lives are are hinging on it. And then, b, it's also primarily consumer facing, which is what we were seeing. And so people are a little bit more impatient than, than companies are. And naturally, we've been conditioned to be that way, so it's expect So the customer experience needs to be able to to take that into account. Things like live updates are extremely necessary, an up to date inventory management system is also extremely necessary because a customer who's expecting good, especially health care good at a certain time, doesn't necessarily have the the ability to wait And so you don't want to be in a situation where that customer's experience is now a, making them lose trust in the company, b, negatively impacting their life in a way that health care Component's good. So I would say that's an example of a trade off, something like speed. Of delivery and visibility within, order shipment statuses. Would be an example of the trade off. That potentially could happen with with a project like this. \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for outlining those trade-offs. Can you also discuss potential opportunities for future enhancements or expansions once the initial integration project is successfully implemented? What steps would you recommend taking to ensure these enhancements are future-proof?\n', ""Interviewee: Yeah. So this is, good question. I think a lot of what I've seen as far as expansion and and potential enhancements really relate to the way that the customer goes through the ordering process. I found that that kinda coupled with customer service, like, a really tight customer service to ordering loop has a lot of what we ended up doing that ended up actually helping quite a bit from an enhancement standpoint. So say for instance, a customer only has the ability to order via web. Still the most common way that individuals are going and handling some of these orders, especially if we're looking at the kind of b to b space, especially in electronics. And then if you're looking at health care items, that's completely fine and completely normal. However, a big part of what we were scoping for the next enhancement was the mobile integration. So being able to get people access to these goods via their phone, so it's a much more convenient ordering process That's an example of something that I think would be a huge enhancement that would allow individuals to especially kind of on the b to c side, it would allow them to more naturally indoctrinate this type of work into their, their typical workflow. I think that that's a very important enhancement both from a customer experience side but also from a system side. So in terms of what I believe would be need needed to take into account or would need to be taken to account rather, Just to make sure that this exists is something that has a mobile application building able making sure that you're building your page to be responsive Regardless of what form or what medium you're going through, Being able to handle your testing on your different on your different with your site, your application, your different modalities, I guess. Is a is a good way to put that into take that into consideration. And then making sure that your application's experience and your web experience are seamless between the two. And so if I'm somebody who goes to an application for a website that I typically approach, and go to. I don't like when one seems like it's completely, like, different from the other. I think that the experience should be a uniform one when it goes from let's say, mobile to web. And so making sure that that that's taken into account When, when the initial implementation is being done, as far as enhancements are concerned. My concern. \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your insights and experiences. Given the complexity of such integration projects, how would you ensure effective communication and collaboration across cross-functional teams globally, especially considering different time zones and potential remote work scenarios?\n', ""Interviewee: So a big portion of what we actually ended up doing we had core members of each team Colocate. On a fairly regular basis. That way, there would be an e an easy exchange of information. But we did have developers that were based all over from China to India to Belgium and then the US. There is a bit of like, a sacrifice that's required, just to make sure that everybody can at least have some working hours that are synchronous because some of those things do need to take place. But I really think it comes down to the personnel. The leader of each individual Like I mentioned, there was a front end team, there was an integration team, back end team, etcetera. For one of these projects. Those individuals, each one needs to have, like, a very, very clear understanding of what their individual group is required to to provide I think the biggest mentality shift that was required in order for us to be able to successfully deliver this was yes, getting your own work was done, but everybody's, like, active first goal needs to make sure that they are not blocking anybody else, with teams with this highest this high level of dependency given their their complexity. When a team lead was no longer working to unblock everybody else, it became very, very apparent So that ended up having cascading effects as far as slowing things down. I would say as far as communication is concerned, yes, we did have a Slack channel, and so making sure everybody is utilizing that actually is aware of the fact that they need to understand very, very very, very minutely what they are doing and how that implements or impacts the full project. But then the last part is really just making sure that the mentality is is correct as far as everybody understands that, yes, this is the But But your primary goal is to make sure that you are not blocking anybody else on the team at all times. And so if there's work that needs to be done as far as a feature build that's independent and there's work that needs to be done in terms of unblocking, unblocking needs to be be the priority, and that needs to be communicated just very, very clearly and very often to \n""], ['Interviewer: Thank you for taking the time to interview with us!
